	abstract = {Harmony is the process of coordinated development between the elements, subsystems and the environment in each Engineering stage of the engineering implementation. Quality, duration, cost and risk are the key factors to achieve engineering harmony. Clarifying the influencing factors of engineering harmony and its mechanism can improve the possibility of success. The meta-analysis method is used to carry out a restudy of existing researches of engineering harmony. First, quality, duration, cost and risk are selected as the variables of achieving engineering harmony. Second, the paper collects 29 existing researches including many countries and regions around the world on the relationship between the variables and engineering harmony. Third, each value is calculated and corrected according to literature coding. Forth, publication deviation and total effect test are checked. Finally, the research conclusions and engineering management implications are given based on the results of meta-analysis. The results show that quality objective, duration objective, cost objective and risk management objective all have positive impact on achieving engineering harmony. The engineering type has no regulatory effect on positive impact of the duration objective and cost objective, but has regulatory effect on positive impact of the quality objective and risk management objective on the engineering harmony.},

Despite its potential benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This development is founded in the fact that the far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the state of the art as well as the state of practice of Industry 4.0 relating technologies in the construction industry by pointing out the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal implications of its adoption. In this context, we present the results of our triangulation approach, which consists of a comprehensive systematic literature review and case study research, by illustrating a PESTEL framework and a value chain model.

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, it aims at empirically validating bundles of Lean Automation (LA) practices and principles. Second, it verifies their impact on operational performance improvement. For that, we surveyed 110 manufacturers who have been concomitantly implementing Lean Production (LP) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). The collected responses were examined using multivariate data analysis techniques. We identified three bundles of LA named according to the focus of the corresponding practices (i.e. workplace, value stream and extended value stream), and two bundles of LA principles (sociocultural- and technology-oriented). Our findings indicated that LA practices positively mediate the relationship between LA principles and the company's operational performance, especially when considering practices applied at a workplace or value stream level. As the integration of I4.0 into LP becomes widespread, the LA paradigm tends to be a more relevant topic in the operations management field. Hence, more profound comprehension of LA practices and principles, and their implications on companies' operations may help achieve higher performance, setting the proper managerial expectations.},

Second, based on these results, we propose a framework for Lean Automation (LA) implementation, in which I4.0 technologies are integrated into LP practices. Design/methodology/approach To achieve that, a cross-sector survey was performed with 147 manufacturers that are undergoing a LP implementation aided by novel information and communication technologies from I4.0. Multivariate data analysis was applied in order to underpin the proposed framework for LA. Findings Findings indicate that I4.0 technologies are positively correlated with LP practices, providing evidence to bear the proposition of a LA framework that can potentially overcome traditional barriers and challenges of a LP implementation. Originality/value As previous studies have approached LA implementation from a narrow perspective or including a limited set of LP practices and I4.0 technologies, the proposition of an integrated framework unfolds a wider range of synergistic implementations that may corroborate to a holistic approach for continuous improvement in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.},

Since the environment is instantiated automatically by the infrastructure languages' tools, no manual intervention is necessary apart from maintaining the infrastructure specification files. The amount of work involved with such maintenance, as well as the size and complexity of infrastructure specification files, have not yet been studied empirically. Through an empirical study of the version control system of 265 Open Stack projects, we find that infrastructure files are large and churn frequently, which could indicate a potential of introducing bugs. Furthermore, we found that the infrastructure code files are coupled tightly with the other files in a project, especially test files, which implies that testers often need to change infrastructure specifications when making changes to the test framework and tests.},

	abstract = {In a continuously changing environment, a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) has to evolve to sustain or improve its effectiveness. The main task of a CSIRT is to mitigate the effects of computer security incidents. A frequently identified problem is that CSIRTs are over-worked, under-staffed and under-funded. We present a conceptual model of such conditions based on a case study. The model is a first attempt to understand the main factors influencing a CSIRT’s effectiveness, and to improve its performance. Based on theory from process improvement and information from the case study, we identified that short-term pressure from a growing incident work load prevents attempts for developing more response capability long-term, leading the CSIRT into a “capability trap”. Fundamental solutions will typically involve a worse-before-better trade-off for management. Short term the CSIRT will lower its response capability while new capability is developed. Long term the CSIRT will get an automated response capability independent from limited human resources. Hence, it can automatically scale to future increases in workload.},

The idea that small disruptions and delays can ripple through the project and mushroom in larger, more serious consequences is well established. Nevertheless, it is hard to identify and accurately prove the consequences of such disruptions. The system dynamic (SD) method is presented in this article as a tool that can show the logic link between cause and effect; that is, disruption/delay/acceleration and productivity loss. This in turn helps quantify productivity loss. Because the SD technique recognizes and models the interaction of work activities and graphically illustrates the mechanism by which disruption occurs, the results are accurate and persuasive. This article describes how to establish and use the SD model for acceleration, delay, and disruption purposes with a simple example. The importance and sensitivity of the coefficients in the SD model are also discussed.},

DevOps is a recent concept, and many organizations are moving from old-style software development methods to agile approaches such as DevOps. However, there is no comprehensive information on what factors impact the success of the DevOps environment once organizations adopt it. This research focused on addressing this gap through a systematic literature review. The systematic review consisted of 33 articles from five selected search systems and databases from 2015 to 2021. Based on the included articles, 15 factors were identified and grouped into four categories: Collaborative Culture, Organizational Aspects, Tooling and Technology, and Continuous Practices. In addition, this research proposes a DevOps environment success factors model to potentially contribute to DevOps research and practice. Recommendations are made for additional research on the effectiveness of the proposed model and its success factors.},

However, they are often systems suited to their purpose, they deliver the expected value and investment in them is justifiable. The concept of DevOps has come to reduce the separation between existing development and operations teams in software development companies, decreasing the product lifecycle. With this concept comes the practice of continuous delivery, allowing teams to deliver and deploy any version of their software in any computing environment at any time through a fully automated process. This practice improves the feedback of the development process, so that problems are identified and resolved as early as possible. In this paper, we present a case study of deploying DevOps, and propose a formal process for deploying DevOps and its modifications necessary to adapt to legacy systems so that the delivery process of the legacy systems has a short and high quality lifecycle, delivering frequent versions in an automated way.},

This paper explores and highlights these challenges through an open ended survey (N = 15) and in-depth interviews with DevOps professionals (N = 16). According to the findings, there are various challenges while implementing DevOps in the organizations. The research suggests that (i) lack of team coordination, (ii) risky change and development, (iii) team members expertise level, (iv) lack of focus or differences in development, (v) test and production environment, (vi) poorly defined functional and technical requirements, (vii) poor integration and test process, (viii) pipeline execution problems, (ix) tools integration challenges, (x) people challenges and silo-ed thinking, (xi) debugging challenges due to remote execution, (xii) feature release challenges, (xiii) integrating new standards, (xiv) challenges with clients, (xv) knowledge sharing, (xvi) responsibility distribution issues are the challenges while using DevOps. The founded list of perceived challenges will help future research to suggest mitigation and risk management strategies for successful use of DevOps.},

The model was born as it was observed that information systems operations and information system developments are closely integrated activities for the success of any organization. Thus, DevOps methods are an addition for the companies to improve overall performance in their software development process and operations. DevOps fills the gap between the development and operations teams and maintains the collaboration among information technology professionals for delivering the software applications. Due to its recent emergence, there are relatively little research done, at least when compared to the other software process models, on DevOps and its successful usage. Previously, some empirical research studies have been conducted on the success factors of DevOps, but a synthesis of these findings is needed. This paper aims to find out various critical success factors of DevOps projects that have been discussed in prior research by following a systematic literature review. Based on our extensive keyword search and after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, we have included 30 research articles in this paper. The identified critical success factors were categorized into technical, organizational and social and cultural dimensions. Finally, this study offers a comprehensive framework depicting how the critical success factors impact or drive DevOps success.},

We briefly discuss why this important notion is so controversial. To this end, we classify major types of models, particularly as they impact the notion of model credibility: i- Purely statistical forecasting (black box) models, and ii- Causal-descriptive policy (transparent) models. We then focus on what makes causal-descriptive model credibility and evaluation unique and quite difficult, compared to short-term forecasting models. One important result is that causal-descriptive model credibility consists of two different aspects: structural and behavioral. In most simulation modeling (particularly system dynamics policy simulation), establishing structure credibility must strictly precede behavior credibility; the latter has no value without the former. We thus discuss Structural tests and output behavior tests for dynamic simulation models separately. Structure tests can further be classified into direct and indirect structure tests. We place special emphasis on indirect structure tests. We also provide a quick overview of recent model testing software developed in SESDYN Laboratory at Boğaziçi University. Finally we discuss model credibility in broader context and some implementation issues.},

Among the many ways to support production systems, forecasting and simulation of production systems is one of a great interest. This is because, among other things, in the simulation process, the course of the various stages of production as a function of time can be analyzed in a way that is not practically feasible. This article is based on cooperation between the world of science and business. The aim of the paper is to present new opportunities for improving the efficiency of a viable enterprise. This article describes primarily a different approach to problem solving based on the simulation of the production process using the Vensim program designed to describe diverse environments. The paper is scheduled to be the first in a series that uses Vensim’s simulation capabilities. In this article, the focus is on presenting the process of building a simulation model and the overall benefits of this. Already the process of building the model has revealed very interesting areas of analysis, related to lack of tools to support current decisions. The reason for using the simulation methods was the problems observed in the company: the prolonged time of order execution, the risk of losing customers, the risk of negative audits. Thanks to the use of the simulation model in the current activity, the results were also obtained: defining places of delays, streamlining the flow of information, integrating actions and people, and a comprehensive look at the company’s activities.},

A summary table of the articles found presents the results, helping to compose the findings, identifies disruptive technologies, and their contributions to hospital management. In a public health system patients are constantly admitted in the same health institutions. It is discussed how disruptive technologies can provide practical and innovative solutions that meet the desires of interested parties to maintain a constant and effective flow of care in a way that overcrowding does not occur. In the conclusion, the integration between health institutions and disruptive technologies can bring improvements in the work process and in the performance of professionals in the public hospitals.

	abstract = {Hospital systems are under constant pressure to provide quality care despite limited resources. However, traditional capacity management in hospitals is often not effective enough. One reason for this is the variability and uncertainty in the healthcare field that has to be managed. Another reason is the observation that hospitals are open loop systems, meaning they do not use feedback to determine if their output has achieved the desired goal of input. They do not observe the output of their processes controlled by them and use this information to take action. In hospital systems, there are few efficient planning systems or decision support systems to help administrators take decisions. This is different in other industries, where complex planning systems with the help of Artificial Intelligence, or AI as it is referred to, are often being used. This research chapter analyses the issues and possibilities for hospitals to incorporate AI into their capacity management and become intelligent systems in which operations and processes are regulated by feedback (closed loop system) and, more specifically, discusses the recent research of the authors on this topic, where Artificial Intelligent (Multi-Agent System) methods in combination with real-time coordination were described and implemented in the Aravind Eye Hospital (AEH) in India.},

	abstract = {The rapidly growing population and the current global healthcare issues can take advantage of the ongoing technological improvements to enhance human life quality. In healthcare, the use of telemedicine can provide high-quality services for medical evaluation without location restrictions. Telemedicine can significantly improve service quality, personnel management, and resource utilization in the emergency department, reducing operational budget and problems like overcrowding. This chapter presents a dynamic personnel allocation system to manage a fluctuating number of remote physicians, opposite to traditional management practices. The proposed healthcare paradigm is based on telemedicine-based management, requiring a validation simulation tools Discrete Event Simulation (DES). This smart management system was solved using control theory techniques enhanced with soft-computing algorithms like Genetic and Memetic algorithms. This concept’s potential implementation requires extensive use of concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT), achieving an e-Hospital with a smart management system. This work most significant results were the Emergency Department service quality maximization and reduced operational costs under normal and abnormal conditions. The identified improvements were measured using different key performance indicators, which helped evaluate this proposal’s improvements quantitatively. Consequently, the service quality and personnel wellbeing were improved. This proposal presents a novel synergy between healthcare management and current disrupting technologies that belongs to the fourth industrial revolution. Likewise, it opens and spreads a consistent perspective of dynamic personnel shifting, integrating healthcare management concepts, telemedicine, automatic control, soft computing, IoT, Industry 4.0, and Health 4.0.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with a scheduling problem in many real-world systems where the customers must be waiting for a service known as queueing system. Classical queueing systems are handled using probabilistic theories, mostly based on asymptotic theory and/or samples analysis. We address a situation where neither enough statistical data exists, nor asymptotic behavior can be applied to. This way, we propose to use an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method to infer scheduling rules of a queueing problem, based on uncertain data. We use the utilization ratio and the work in process (WIP) of a queue to train an ANFIS network to finally obtain the estimated cycle time of all tasks. Multiple tasks and rework are considered into the problem, so it cannot be easily modeled using classical probability theory. The experiment results through simulation analysis show an improvement of our ANFIS method in the performance measures compared with traditional scheduling policies.},

In addition, there are situations where the deficiency of data due to the lack of a real scenario or device makes it impossible to use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, this problem could be solved with simulation, being a fundamental mechanism for predicting and forecasting not-existing scenarios. In this paper, we proposed the use of Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) to model complex HMS scenarios. We have integrated a simulation module based on Matlab Simulink, into the MoSTHealth framework, so that the digital twins (DTs) modelled by the framework are elements of the DES scenario that the medical expert can easily parameterize through a mobile interface. A case study has been defined on the use of a wearable device (under development) that collects relevant hormone levels in real time, during infertility treatment. The DES simulation demonstrates an increase in the number of patients seen by one physician by 88,8\%. In addition, the average waiting time for consultation decreased by 36.5\%.},

This medical practice can be defined by the use of telecommunication means to provide care, health promotion, treatment, information exchange between doctors and researchers, and also for various health research. However, there are still many methodologies that present a large consumption of computational memory as well as slowness in sending medical data. And with that focus, the present research aims to implement discrete event modeling, called CBEDE (Coding of Bits for Entities by Discrete Events) to improve the transmission of medical data by specifying the wide spectrum of health-related themes. The modeling was performed using the MATLAB Simulink environment, where AWGN communication channel models with DQPSK (Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation were developed and analyzed in relation to information consumption medical data in MB (megabytes). The proposal directs a different approach with respect to signal transmission, employing in the discrete domain the effect of discrete entities’ technique in the bit generation step, aiming to increase the information capacity transmission in healthcare systems, showing better memory consumption utilization regards improvement of 95.86\%. Since diagnostic health interaction offered by e-health enables digital solutions for faster and better-quality health care, enabling the optimization of healthcare services, generating greater interaction between physician and patient, as well as all agents in system health care, where CBEDE methodology may enable faster and more efficient scheduling of consultations, transmission devices monitoring data from patients, presenting great potential for the transmission of medical data.},

If the questions that are to be answered by the model relate not to determining fundamental laws and reasons that determine dynamics of the real system but to practical analysis of its behavior, application of imitation modeling is justified. For studying the peculiarities of functioning and evaluating the indicators of efficiency of bank department’s work, an imitation model of the system of mass service is presented, the incoming flow of applications of which has visible distribution, and time of customer service is subject to the normal law of distribution. The computer experiment is performed in the modeling environment SimEvents of the MATLAB Simulink system.

The process of model building and validation is analysed from a theory-building perspective. The resulting theory is evaluated by means of a set of criteria for high-quality theories. As a conclusion, the insights thus gained are presented and condensed in a tentative set of heuristic principles for model-based theory building. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {System dynamics models of organizational problems have been constructed since the 1950s. In the second half of the 1970s publications began appearing on explicit procedures to involve clients in the process of model construction. After about 30 years of applying and researching participative modelling approaches, it is useful to consider the extent to which these procedures have matured into a full-blown methodology. Does client involvement in system dynamics modelling yield repeatable results? Is the procedure adequately codified, or does its success depend on the experience and skills of the practitioner? Participative modelling is often associated with beneficial process results, such as consensus and participants' commitment to results. What evidence do we have that these ‘soft’ results actually materialize? Which conditions (types of interventions and client or problem characteristics) are especially favourable to these outcomes? The paper discusses these questions and closes with a set of topics relevant for further development of participative modelling and alternative strategies to study these topics.

Despite numerous examples of the implementation of Industry 4.0 in enterprises, there is no general framework for the implementation of Industry 4.0 with a detailed schedule. Researching the ways of implementing Industry 4.0 is still a current and unexplored area of research. The main aim of the paper is to present the concept of the theoretical framework for Industry 4.0 implementation based on selected schedules of the Industry 4.0 implementation. The paper was based on information from literature review and analysis of pilot enterprise projects to Industry 4.0 (case study) that were conducted in selected enterprises. The paper presents the key components of the framework of Industry 4.0 and the basic stage of implementing the concept in the enterprises, paying attention to their sequence and time frames. The proposed approach is dedicated to researchers and practitioners who implement the concept of Industry 4.0 in enterprises.},

In RPA, robots, or ‘bots’ for short, represent software agents capable of interacting with software systems by mimicking user actions, thus alleviating the workload of the human workforce. RPA has already seen significant uptake in practice; solution technologies are offered by multiple vendors. Contrasting with this early practical adoption is the hitherto relative lack of attention to RPA in the academic literature. As a consequence, RPA lacks the sound theoretical foundations that allow for objective reasoning around its application and development. This, in turn, hinders initiatives for achieving meaningful advances in the field. This paper presents a structured literature review that identifies a number of contemporary, RPA-related themes and challenges for future research.},

This makes it essential to identify and select the most suitable processes to maximize the benefits for organizations. However, despite the increasing interest of academics and professionals in RPA, the literature lacks a study on the main criteria organizations should consider to decide which processes to automate. Therefore, this research lists the main criteria for process automation based on scientific and professional know-how. A systematic literature review was performed, followed by a Delphi study with RPA professionals, to tune the former insights collected from the scientific literature. Our findings point to 32 criteria that organizations and decision-makers should consider before choosing which processes to automate. Feasibility, process description, and input and output data are the most voted. The criteria are evaluated with 18 processes in six organizations with positive results. While professionals may find valuable information in this document to help them decide which processes must be automated first, academics are now aware of which areas deserve further investigation.},

These software robots can handle various rule-based, digital, repetitive tasks. However, currently available process identification methods must be qualified to select suitable automation processes accurately. Wrong process selection and failed attempts are often the origin of process automation's bad reputation within organizations and often result in the avoidance of this technology. As a result, in this research, a method for selecting processes for automation combining two multi-criteria decision-making techniques, 'Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), will be proposed, demonstrated, and evaluated. This study follows the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and applies the proposed method for selecting processes for automation to a real-life scenario. The result will be a method to support the proper selection of business processes for automation, increasing the success of implementing RPA tools in an organization.},

	abstract = {Robotic process automation is a disruptive technology to automate already digital yet manual tasks and subprocesses as well as whole business processes rapidly. In contrast to other process automation technologies, robotic process automation is lightweight and only accesses the presentation layer of IT systems to mimic human behavior. Due to the novelty of robotic process automation and the varying approaches when implementing the technology, there are reports that up to 50\% of robotic process automation projects fail. To tackle this issue, we use a design science research approach to develop a framework for the implementation of robotic process automation projects. We analyzed 35 reports on real-life projects to derive a preliminary sequential model. Then, we performed multiple expert interviews and workshops to validate and refine our model. The result is a framework with variable stages that offers guidelines with enough flexibility to be applicable in complex and heterogeneous corporate environments as well as for small and medium-sized companies. It is structured by the three phases of initialization, implementation, and scaling. They comprise eleven stages relevant during a project and as a continuous cycle spanning individual projects. Together they structure how to manage knowledge and support processes for the execution of robotic process automation implementation projects.},

Traditional methods of graphically comparing computational and experimental results, though valuable, are essentially qualitative. Computable measures are needed that can quantitatively compare computational and experimental results over a range of input, or control, variables to sharpen assessment of computational accuracy. This type of measure has been recently referred to as a validation metric. We discuss various features that we believe should be incorporated in a validation metric, as well as features that we believe should be excluded. We develop a new validation metric that is based on the statistical concept of conﬁdence intervals. Using this fundamental concept, we construct two speciﬁc metrics: one that requires interpolation of experimental data and one that requires regression (curve ﬁtting) of experimental data. We apply the metrics to three example problems: thermal decomposition of a polyurethane foam, a turbulent buoyant plume of helium, and compressibility eﬀects on the growth rate of a turbulent free-shear layer. We discuss how the present metrics are easily interpretable for assessing computational model accuracy, as well as the impact of experimental measurement uncertainty on the accuracy assessment.},

To facilitate their use, this study aims to investigate the robustness of individual techniques across a set of scenarios from different domains. Experimental results show that Control Variates is the only technique which achieves a reduction in variance across all domains. Furthermore, applied individually, Antithetic Variates and Control Variates perform particularly well in the Cross-docking scenarios, which was previously unknown.},

Although reports by astronauts of the Apollo missions indicate alternative gait strategies might be favored on the Moon, computational simulations and experimental investigations have been almost exclusively limited to the study of either walking or running, the locomotion modes preferred under Earth's gravity. In order to investigate the gait strategies likely to be favored at low gravity a series of predictive, computational simulations of gait are performed using a physiological model of the musculoskeletal system, without assuming any particular type of gait. A computationally efficient optimization strategy is utilized allowing for multiple simulations. The results reveal skipping as more efficient and less fatiguing than walking or running and suggest the existence of a walk–skip rather than a walk–run transition at low gravity. The results are expected to serve as a background to the design of experimental investigations of gait under simulated low gravity.},

	abstract = {With the increasing role of computational modeling in engineering design, performance estimation, and safety assessment, improved methods are needed for comparing computational results and experimental measurements. Traditional methods of graphically comparing computational and experimental results, though valuable, are essentially qualitative. Computable measures are needed that can quantitatively compare computational and experimental results over a range of input, or control, variables to sharpen assessment of computational accuracy. This type of measure has been recently referred to as a validation metric. We discuss various features that we believe should be incorporated in a validation metric, as well as features that we believe should be excluded. We develop a new validation metric that is based on the statistical concept of conﬁdence intervals. Using this fundamental concept, we construct two speciﬁc metrics: one that requires interpolation of experimental data and one that requires regression (curve ﬁtting) of experimental data. We apply the metrics to three example problems: thermal decomposition of a polyurethane foam, a turbulent buoyant plume of helium, and compressibility eﬀects on the growth rate of a turbulent free-shear layer. We discuss how the present metrics are easily interpretable for assessing computational model accuracy, as well as the impact of experimental measurement uncertainty on the accuracy assessment.},

The objective of this review is to present the concepts of verification, validation and sensitivity studies with regard to the construction, analysis and interpretation of models in computational biomechanics. Specific examples from the field are discussed.

New approaches are required to gain better fundamental understanding of uncertainty and to realize practical methods to manage them.

This book details how the PMO applies professional project management practices and successfully integrates business interests with project goals— regardless of whether the scope of the PMO is limited to managing a handful of specific projects or expanded to oversee the total practice of project management within the organization. The book first considers the five stages of PMO capability, each benchmarking a particular level of capability achieved if functions are fully implemented. Each stage is also indicative of the organization’s maturity in project management, with the PMO’s role and responsibilities advancing from project management oversight and control at the lower end of the competency continuum to strategic business alignment at the higher competency stages. This revised edition then examines 20 function models that can be used to guide the organization through the deliberation and the development of PMO operational capability. These models suggest what project management capability can be realized through comprehensive implementation of each PMO function. Providing project and business managers with a starting point that enables them to achieve desired results from project management, The Complete Project Management Office Handbook is an important resource for everyone involved in making project management work effectively within the organization.},

In the most prestigious journals and media outlets, which influence many people’s opinions about sexism, bias is frequently portrayed as an omnipresent factor limiting women’s progress in the tenure-track academy. Claims and counterclaims regarding the presence or absence of sexism span a range of evaluation contexts. Our approach relied on a combination of meta-analysis and analytic dissection. We evaluated the empirical evidence for gender bias in six key contexts in the tenure-track academy: (a) tenure-track hiring, (b) grant funding, (c) teaching ratings, (d) journal acceptances, (e) salaries, and (f) recommendation letters. We also explored the gender gap in a seventh area, journal productivity, because it can moderate bias in other contexts. We focused on these specific domains, in which sexism has most often been alleged to be pervasive, because they represent important types of evaluation, and the extensive research corpus within these domains provides sufficient quantitative data for comprehensive analysis. Contrary to the omnipresent claims of sexism in these domains appearing in top journals and the media, our findings show that tenure-track women are at parity with tenure-track men in three domains (grant funding, journal acceptances, and recommendation letters) and are advantaged over men in a fourth domain (hiring). For teaching ratings and salaries, we found evidence of bias against women; although gender gaps in salary were much smaller than often claimed, they were nevertheless concerning. Even in the four domains in which we failed to find evidence of sexism disadvantaging women, we nevertheless acknowledge that broad societal structural factors may still impede women’s advancement in academic science. Given the substantial resources directed toward reducing gender bias in academic science, it is imperative to develop a clear understanding of when and where such efforts are justified and of how resources can best be directed to mitigate sexism when and where it exists.},

	url = {https://osf.io/sfubr},
	abstract = {In three studies (two preregistered; total n = 3,490 ideologically balanced U.S. adults), we examined attitudes toward 40 institutions, organizations, and groups of professionals (e.g., journalists, scientists, the Supreme Court, the World Health Organization, professors, police officers, doctors, the Catholic Church, banks, pharmaceutical companies, psychologists, Facebook), and tested the associations between (1) perceived ideological slant (the percentage of people in those institutions that lean politically left or right), (2) perceived politicization (the extent to which political values impact the work they do), and (3) public trust and willingness to support and defer to the institution’s expertise. Higher congruence between participant ideology and perceived institutional slant predicted higher trust and deference. And higher perceived politicization of institutions consistently predicted lower trust, often with large effect sizes. Similar patterns were observed between institutions, such that the institutions perceived as the most politicized were also the least trusted, with a very large effect, r = -0.76. Studies 2 and 3 found that perceived politicization also predicted lower support and willingness to defer to institutions’ expertise. Across studies, these negative relationships were observed among both participants who shared and opposed the institution’s ideological slant. In other words, even left-leaning participants were less trusting and less willing to support and defer to left-leaning institutions that appeared more politicized, and even right-leaning participants were less trusting and less willing to support and defer to right-leaning institutions that appeared more politicized. Studies 2 and 3 attempted to experimentally manipulate perceived politicization and failed to do so. We thus post this preprint in hopes of initiating discussion of these findings and identifying promising avenues for future research and possible interventions.},

	abstract = {Previous research indicated that corrective information can sometimes provoke a so-called “backfire effect” in which respondents more strongly endorsed a misperception about a controversial political or scientific issue when their beliefs or predispositions were challenged. I show how subsequent research and media coverage seized on this finding, distorting its generality and exaggerating its role relative to other factors in explaining the durability of political misperceptions. To the contrary, an emerging research consensus finds that corrective information is typically at least somewhat effective at increasing belief accuracy when received by respondents. However, the research that I review suggests that the accuracy-increasing effects of corrective information like fact checks often do not last or accumulate; instead, they frequently seem to decay or be overwhelmed by cues from elites and the media promoting more congenial but less accurate claims. As a result, misperceptions typically persist in public opinion for years after they have been debunked. Given these realities, the primary challenge for scientific communication is not to prevent backfire effects but instead, to understand how to target corrective information better and to make it more effective. Ultimately, however, the best approach is to disrupt the formation of linkages between group identities and false claims and to reduce the flow of cues reinforcing those claims from elites and the media. Doing so will require a shift from a strategy focused on providing information to the public to one that considers the roles of intermediaries in forming and maintaining belief systems.},

	abstract = {A material called LK-99®, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the composition (Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O (0.9{\textless}x{\textless}1.1)), has been synthesized using the solid-state method. The material exhibits the Ohmic metal characteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature, Tc, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure below Tc. A LK-99® sample shows Tc above 126.85℃ (400K). We analyze that the possibility of room-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two factors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second being on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural deformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2−O1/2−Pb2 along the c-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at Tc. The mechanism of the room-temperature Tc is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a profit-oriented shift scheduling approach for inbound contact centers. The focus is on systems in which multiple agent classes with different qualifications serve multiple customer classes with different needs. We assume that customers are impatient, abandon if they have to wait, and that they may retry. A discrete-time modeling approach is used to capture the dynamics of the system due to time-dependent arrival rates. Staffing levels and shift schedules are simultaneously optimized over a set of different approximate realizations of the underlying stochastic processes to consider the randomness of the system. The numerical results indicate that the presented approach works best for medium-sized and large contact centers with skills-based routing of customers for which stochastic queueing models are rarely applicable.},

Based on interviews with 30 key individuals across health and social care, a ‘conceptual map’ of the system was developed, showing potential patient pathways through the system. This was used to construct a stock-flow model, populated with current activity data, in order to simulate patient flows and to identify system bottle-necks. Without intervention, assuming current trends continue, Nottingham hospitals are unlikely to reach elective admission targets or achieve the government target of 82\% bed occupancy. Admissions from general practice had the greatest influence on occupancy rates. Preventing a small number of emergency admissions in elderly patients showed a substantial effect, reducing bed occupancy by 1\% per annum over 5 years. Modelling indicated a range of undesirable outcomes associated with continued growth in demand for emergency care, but also considerable potential to intervene to alleviate these problems, in particular by increasing the care options available in the community.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a generic framework for hybrid (integrated deployment of system dynamics and discrete event simulation) simulation which can be applied in the healthcare domain. Design/methodology/approach – As hybrid simulation in an organisational context is a new topic with limited available data on deployment of hybrid simulation in organisational context, an inductive approach has been applied. On the basis of knowledge induced from literature, a generic conceptual framework for hybrid simulation has been developed. The proposed framework is demonstrated using an explanatory case study comprising an accident and emergency (A\&E) department. Findings – The framework provided detailed guidance for the development of a hybrid model of an A\&E case study. Findings of this case study suggest that the hybrid model was more efficient in capturing behavioural impact on operational performances. Research limitations/implications – The framework is limited to only SD and DES; as agent‐based is another simulation method which is emerging as a promising tool for analysing problems such as spread of infectious diseases in healthcare context, inclusion of this into the framework will enhance the utility of the framework. Practical implications – This framework will aid in the development of hybrid models capable of comprehending both detail as well as dynamic complexity, which will contribute towards a deeper understanding of the problems, resulting in more effective decision making. Social implications – It is expected that this research will encourage those engaged in simulation (e.g. researchers, practitioners, decision makers) to realise the potential of cross‐fertilisation of the two simulation paradigms. Originality/value – Currently, there is no conceptual framework which provides guidance for developing hybrid models. In order to address this gap, this paper contributes by proposing a conceptual framework for hybrid simulation for the healthcare domain.},

The generated verbal protocols are divided into seven modelling topics: problem structuring, conceptual modelling, data inputs, model coding, verification \& validation, results \& experimentation and implementation and then analyzed. Our results suggest that all modellers switch between modelling topics, however DES modellers follow a more linear progression. DES modellers focus significantly more on model coding and verification \& validation, whereas SD modellers on conceptual modelling.

	abstract = {Software development life cycle or SDLC for short is a methodology for designing, building, and maintaining information and industrial systems. So far, there exist many SDLC models, one of which is the Waterfall model which comprises five phases to be completed sequentially in order to develop a software solution. However, SDLC of software systems has always encountered problems and limitations that resulted in significant budget overruns, late or suspended deliveries, and dissatisfied clients. The major reason for these deficiencies is that project directors are not wisely assigning the required number of workers and resources on the various activities of the SDLC. Consequently, some SDLC phases with insufficient resources may be delayed; while, others with excess resources may be idled, leading to a bottleneck between the arrival and delivery of projects and to a failure in delivering an operational product on time and within budget. This paper proposes a simulation model for the Waterfall development process using the Simphony.NET simulation tool whose role is to assist project managers in determining how to achieve the maximum productivity with the minimum number of expenses, workers, and hours. It helps maximizing the utilization of development processes by keeping all employees and resources busy all the time to keep pace with the arrival of projects and to decrease waste and idle time. As future work, other SDLC models such as spiral and incremental are to be simulated, giving project executives the choice to use a diversity of software development methodologies.},

At present, very little is known about SBR. We develop a discrete-event simulation model to analyze the performance of a M/sub n//M/sub n//C/K SBR environment in which incoming calls are handled in priority order and in a nonpreemptive manner. We use the design of experiment framework to conduct our analysis. We show empirically that the scenario in which agents have 2 skills is almost as efficient as the scenario where agents have all skills (resource pooling). Also, we discover that no interaction exists between call rate factors when resource pooling exists.},

The fluid model is attractive to provide a rough analysis of large systems, with high arrival rate and many servers. Even though the fluid model evolves deterministically, the service-time distributions and time-to-abandon distributions beyond their means play a critical role.

In such systems, customers of multiple classes are routed to servers of multiple skills. In the settings we consider, each server skill is associated with a corresponding cost, and service level can either appear as a strong constraint or incur a cost. The solution we propose is based on the Stochastic Approximation (SA) approach. Since SBR models are analytically intractable in general, we use computer simulation to evaluate service-level measures. Under the assumption of convexity of the service-level as functions in staffing levels, SA provides an analytical proof of convergence, together with a rate of convergence. We show, via numerical examples, that although the convexity assumption does not hold for all cases and all types of service-level objectives, the algorithm nevertheless identifies the optimal solution.},

	abstract = {The multidivisional firm is modeled as a system of interconnected nodes that exchange continuous flows of projects of varying urgency and queue waiting tasks. The main innovation over existing models is that the rate at which waiting projects are taken into processing depends positively on both the availability of resources and the size of the queue, capturing a salient quality of human organizations. A transfer pricing scheme for decentralizing the system is presented, and conditions are given to determine which nodes can be operated autonomously. It is shown that a node can be managed separately from the rest of the system when all of the projects flowing through it are equally urgent.},

	abstract = {This research examines a heuristic, rule-based approach for setting due dates in a multiproject, multijob, or assembly shop. Due date estimation is a challenging problem because the operating environment is capacitated, involves the allocation of multiple resources, and allows for the preemption of resources from one project or job to another. The dynamic, continuous arrival of new jobs or orders frequently results in the preemption of resources through the application of managerially determined priority policies. These preemption policies have a significant impact on the ultimate completion time of a job or a project. A three-factor, full-factorial computer simulation experiment is used to assess the relative effectiveness of combinations of four due date setting heuristics, five resource assignment heuristics, and three resource preemption heuristics. Recommendations are made for the selection of due date and resource assignment heuristic combinations under the three preemption policies examined.},

The paper continues an on-going discussion in the literature about the potential benefits of linking DES and SD. Previous researchers have argued that DES and SD are complementary approaches and many real-world problems would benefit from combining both methods. In this paper, a DES model of the hospital outpatient clinic which treats Chlamydia patients is combined with an SD model of the infection process in the community. These two models were developed in commercial software and linked in an automated fashion via an Excel interface. To our knowledge this is the first time such a composite model has been used in a healthcare setting. The model shows how the prevalence of Chlamydia at a community level affects (and is affected by) operational level decisions made in the hospital outpatient department. We discuss the additional benefits provided by the composite model over and above the benefits gained from the two individual models.},

In this paper we consider some of the reasons for this and describe two practical healthcare examples of combined DES/SD models, which nevertheless fall short of the “holy grail” which has been so widely discussed in the literature over the past decade.},

The problem of accurately modeling IT support organizations requires the development of sophisticated models as well as dedicated parameter inference techniques and tools. This paper presents a multiple-priority queuing model suited for the reenactment of IT support groups developed from the analysis of empirical evidence, as well as a powerful method to infer the model parameters. We applied our model to reenact the behavior of a real life IT support group with our Symian simulator. The results demonstrate that multiple-priority queuing models can reproduce real life IT support groups with a high degree of accuracy.},

Thorough this study the challenges that emerged during ITIL implementation projects were investigated. The problem addressed in this study was that organization leaders faced challenges when implementing the ITIL framework. There are limited studies from an organization perspective related to the challenges of implementing the ITIL framework found in current literature. The purpose of this quantitative correlational research design was to better understand the challenges organizations experience when implementing the ITIL framework. The complexity theory provided a framework that was used to investigate and explain the challenges of ITIL implementations. The complexity theory concepts of people and processes interaction, unexpected change, uncertainty, unpredictable behavior, and organizations as complex systems provided a framework that was used to analyze these challenges. This study was conducted by via an online questionnaire, which consisted of 17 rating scale, ordinal and nominal type questions, and was accessible on the Qualtrics survey system. The anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to 9,407 itSMF USA members in the United States through posts on its social media sites. The online questionnaire collected data that provided on the following constructs: complexity level, chaotic behavior, uncertainty and resistance. The online questionnaire was accessible for 3 weeks afterwards, the data was extracted from the Qualtrics system and a bivariate correlational analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS (version 21) analytics software. The Spearman's correlation coefficient rho was calculated on the 39 of 60 usable responses and identified a correlation between an organization size in terms of the number of the IT staff and the lack of executive sponsorship, a lack of resources (time and people) and lack of funding; the organization size in terms of annual turnover and the culture of resistance; and the organization maturity and the lack of executive sponsorship all had statistical significance thus the null hypotheses was rejected. Future research might focus on expanding the population beyond the itSMF USA association within the United States, or on small and medium sized organizations to determine if the results would be any different.},

	abstract = {The motivation for the multi-case research was to investigate the practices of the IT professionals as informed by the incremental theory to explore Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and non-ITIL challenges with release and deployment management. A gap exists in the literature on the ITIL and non-ITIL release deployment process, which makes the deployment process still unknown. The scholarly justification for the research became critical to ensuring quality features or changes are delivered on time, on budget, and with quality results. The research question was: How are successful releases accomplished or hindered in an incremental, ITIL, or non-ITIL release management? The research methodology involved a qualitative multi-case study, which included semi-structured interviews, document reviews, and field notes to provide further information and triangulation. The sample and population included 11 ITIL professionals from the LinkedIn groups and 14 non-ITIL professionals. The researcher compiled, organized, and separated into meaningful classifications to identify emerging themes, leveraging the NVivo for Mac software tool. Five primary themes revealed the following: release planning or requirement deficiency, complexity, customer engagement, production deployment, and process change. The findings suggested that challenges with the release and deployment existed with ITIL and non-ITIL participants, while dealing with the intervention of the Agile methodology. The researcher recommended further study of the ITIL challenges from a quantitative perspective to gain some statistics from different organizations to uncover any trends in the way release management is changing. From the perspective of the practitioner researcher, this study meant that perhaps the fusion of the Agile and ITIL framework might be beneficial to minimize some of the existing challenges.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of the technical progression of projects is highly difficult, especially for complex projects where the current state may be obscured by the use of traditional project metrics. Late detection of technical problems leads to high resolution costs and delayed delivery of projects. To counter this, we report on the development of a updated technical metrics process designed to help ensure the on-time delivery, to both cost and schedule, of high quality products by a U.K. Systems Engineering Company. Published best practice suggests the necessity of using planned parameter profiles crafted to support technical metrics; but these have proven difficult to create due to the variance in project types and noise within individual project systems. This paper presents research findings relevant to the creation of a model to help set valid planned parameter profiles for a diverse range of system engineering products; and in establishing how to help project users get meaningful use out of these planned parameter profiles. We present a solution using a System Dynamics (SD) model capable of generating suitable planned parameter profiles. The final validated and verified model overlays the idea of a learning “S-curve” abstraction onto a rework cycle system archetype. Once applied in SD this matched the mental models of experienced engineering managers within the company, and triangulates with validated empirical data from within the literature. This has delivered three key benefits in practice: the development of a heuristic for understanding the work flow within projects, as a result of the interaction between a project learning system and defect discovery; the ability to produce morphologically accurate performance baselines for metrics; and an approach for enabling teams to generate benefit from the model via the use of problem structuring methodology.},

This paper presents a new framework for understanding and integrating the distinct and complementary contributions of systems science, systems thinking, and systems engineering to create an “integrated systems approach”. The key step is to properly separate out and understand the relationship between the triad of: systems science as an objective “science of systems”; systems thinking as concerned with “understanding systems in a human context”; and systems engineering as “creating, adjusting and configuring systems for a purpose”. None of these is a subset of another; all have to be considered as distinct though interdependent subjects. A key conclusion of the paper is that the “correct” choice of system boundary for a particular purpose depends on the property of interest. The insights necessary to inform this choice belong in the domain of “systems thinking”, which thus provides a key input to “systems engineering”. In many systems businesses, the role of “systems architect” or “systems engineer” integrates the skills of systems science, systems thinking and systems engineering - which are therefore all essential competencies for the role.},

Learning how to think in systems is now part of change-agent literacy. And this is the best book of its kind."—Hunter Lovins   In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth—the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet—Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Thinking in Systems is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

Unless this is done, both the potential of the original work and its initial intent risk being lost. It is now necessary to go beyond `a system of systems methodologies' and to embed that work in an explicit proposal for a critical management science.},

	abstract = {System dynamics has been successfully applied to the study of projects for many years. While this modeling has clearly defined the structures which create project dynamics, it has been less helpful in providing explicit policy advice to managers to control project performance. To address this gap we examine the impact of three common project controls available to project managers to address deviations in project performance; (1) exerting pressure on project staff to work faster, (2) having staff work overtime, and/or (3) hiring additional staff. While the three project controls can have short-term benefits for project performance their long-term impacts can be detrimental. The current work presents preliminary results of the research, focusing on the impacts of the three project controls on project rework and the resulting schedule and budget performance. The work describes the development of project control feedback structures, the initial testing and use of a formal system dynamics model of the system, and preliminary results. The work concludes with a description of future project research efforts.},

	abstract = {Systems engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary domain that can benefit from incorporating contributions from fields not typically associated with technical disciplines, including integrating relevant research from social sciences. The study of innovation has produced the diffusion of innovation theory, which identifies variables that affect the adoption rate of innovations. Of these variables, the perceived attributes of the innovation have been shown to have the most significant impact on the adoption rate of innovations. Shaping the innovation attributes of relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability and how they are perceived can accelerate its adoption rate. This theory has the potential to accelerate the adoption rate of SE innovations. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is an SE innovation that, despite its benefits, has not been adopted generally. An evaluation of the attributes of MBSE as defined by the diffusion of innovation theory can aid in understanding its slow diffusion and inform methods to accelerate its adoption. Since there is some evidence to suggest that this theory is applicable to SE and MBSE, additional research should be conducted to determine the best way to utilize its principles.},

	abstract = {Architecture-centric practices are gaining wide-spread acceptance in systems engineering. This process involves capturing the structure, behavior, and rules and their relationships to create an abstract representation of a system, often termed a model of the system. Central to the rules that govern a system are the requirements that are placed on it, often by various stakeholders. These requirements help guide the system development process of a complex entity. In this paper, we discuss an approach for extending the idea of structured requirements (requirements defined through an orderly structure with specific pieces of content that must be filled in) to SysML through customized stereotypes that help enforce the requirement structure through model-based attributes. This approach helps move requirements modeling and management further into the model-based paradigm from the classical textual definitions. In addition, requirements often are customized by the organization defining them through additional attributes. These additional attributes are added to the model-based structured requirement (MBSR) to create a well-defined organizational requirement stereotype. Several examples of the MBSRs are presented using a notional thrust reverser actuation system (TRAS). Several points are made on how this approach can help support more rigorous requirements modeling, analysis, management, and communication throughout the system development process. Future work will involve automatic generation of the textual requirement statements from the attributes, customized validation rules, and customized classifiers for the various attributes.},

	abstract = {Few organizations are fully integrated, program and engineering disciplines often work in isolation, and most organizations have misgivings in their ability to manage complexity. \&nbsp;On the other hand, there are a few bright spots by way of mature forward-looking organizations that have achieved limited integration through Systems Thinking, advanced models and tools.\&nbsp; This requires overcoming the hurdles of resistance to change and adopting new best practices.
Complexity is inherent in the organization, its stakeholders and in its cross-functional processes.\&nbsp;\&nbsp; In large technical projects, complexity exists within the product design and its interrelated components.\&nbsp; Adding to this complexity, how the techno-socio-economic and cultural factors affect the organization, its processes and product are not well understood.
This disconnectedness and inability to understand underlying relationships have led to project cost overruns, rework and delays.\&nbsp; Despite the use of traditional discipline specific-tools and models, product and project failures continue.\&nbsp; When problems occur, shifting the burden from an optimal solution to a quick symptomatic solution can often occur without easy-to-use integrated decision support tools, as well as the processes for using them.\&nbsp;
It has been recognized that integrated decision support tools and models are needed to overcome the challenges in managing complexity.\&nbsp; However, for these tools to be useful, they need to address the complexities of the organization, processes, product and the practical hurdles that affect them.\&nbsp; As well, these tools need to monitor the emergent behaviour and performance of these connected entities throughout the product lifecycle.
There are a number of foundational pillars proposed for the integration of organizations and the development of integrated tools.\&nbsp; These pillars include Systems Thinking, dynamics, engineering and a digital thread between discipline specific models and tools.
Systems Thinking provides for a new perspective and appreciation of the interrelationships within an organization, its processes and its product design.\&nbsp; System Dynamics (SD), as a rigorous tool for Systems Thinking, provides for an understanding of the factors and complexity in these interrelationships.\&nbsp; Systems Engineering (SE) looks at the design, integration and management of complex systems.\&nbsp; With advancement of data analytics, visualization and intelligence augmentation comes easier construction of digital threads for connecting disparate models and tools.\&nbsp; Integrated management models can facilitate and add rigor to Systems Thinking and reduce complexity through a better understanding of interrelationships.\&nbsp; Moreover, a well constructed integrated model can provide for the gaming of change scenarios, trade studies, knowledge growth, and a decision support tool for optimal solutions.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;
Standards are in the works for developing digital threads and frameworks to enable integration. However, the challenge is much broader than just solving the digital thread interconnection issue. \&nbsp;With use of existing technology, Systems Thinking and systems dynamics, an integrated decision-support model was developed and presented at the International Council on Systems Engineering Project Management (PM) and Systems Engineering (SE) Integration Working Group (Jonkers 2020, INCOSE PM-SE WG). \&nbsp;However, the authors of the current paper experienced resistance from SE and PM practitioners and senior leadership at this forum.\&nbsp; Similar resistance was experienced during presentation of the model to mature engineering companies that designed and manufactured safety critical products. These hurdles and potential ways to overcome them are discussed in this paper.
Partially integrated models and tools exist in systems engineering, project management and the social sciences.\&nbsp; Model-based systems engineering and integrated model-based tools have made inroads predominately in the aerospace industry, but for the most part, there has been reluctance to adopt such tools.\&nbsp; While a structured approach by way of foundational pillars has been proposed, it can be difficult for organizations to decide what tools to adopt without a roadmap or process to guide them.
As a first step, increasing knowledge in Systems Thinking is viewed as a catalyst in moving toward integration of people, processes and the product.\&nbsp; Systems Thinking has been viewed as the cornerstone to enabling positive outcomes including shared perspectives and a shared vision, knowledge growth and a learning culture.
The next step involves shaping a governance framework based on proposed foundational pillars for integration.\&nbsp; This framework includes best practices by associations that offer practical tools for integration.\&nbsp; These associations include those who follow a systematic planned approach such as six-sigma methodology and systems engineering.},

	abstract = {Increased use of bioenergy, driven by ambitious climate and energy policies, has led to an upsurge in international bioenergy trade. Simultaneously, it is evident that every node of the bioenergy supply chain, from cultivation of energy crops to production of electricity and heat, is vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, climate change assessments of bioenergy supply chains neither account for the global nature of the bioenergy market, nor the complexity and dynamic interconnectivity between and within different sub-systems in which the bioenergy supply chain is embedded, thereby neglecting potential compounding and cascading impacts of climate change. In this paper, systems thinking is utilised to develop an analytical framework to address this gap, and aided by causal loop diagrams, cascading impacts of climate change are identified for a case study concerning imports of wood pellets from the United States to the European Union. The findings illustrate how the complexity and interconnectivity of the wood pellet supply system predispose the supply chain to various cascading climate change impacts stemming from environmental, social, political and economic domains, and highlight the value of using system-based analysis tools for studying such complex and dynamic systems.},

	abstract = {The use of a dual-level structure in managing the use of resources in a multi-project environment involves two sets of decisions. Resource allocation decisions, usually controlled by a central authority, determine the allocation of resources among projects such that resources are allocated to the critical projects. Once assigned to a project, the resources are managed by an independent project manager who schedules the activities within his project using only the resources assigned to him. This paper evaluates the relative performance of four resource allocation priority rules and six resource transfer rules in conjunction with two activity scheduling rules. The results show that the First in System First Served resource allocation priority rule dominates over the other three proposed resource allocation priority rules with the lowest project tardiness, flowtime, and lateness standard deviation. Further evaluation of the resource transfer rules shows that additional resources should only be transferred into a project just-in-time of expected use, and idle resources which are expected to be utilized within a time period of not longer than two times the resource transfer time should be retained within their assigned project. The minimum late finish activity scheduling rule is also shown to perform better than the minimum slack activity scheduling rule.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges in multi-project environments is the question how to allocate resources to assure a timely completion of all planned projects. In order to increase resource utilization, managers try to allocate all available resources at the beginning of a new cycle to all planned projects. This strategy would not allow for acting on potential risks and uncertainties. Thus, current literature on multi-project planning considers buffer concepts in various forms. The problem with these strategies is their complexities and consequently their general rejection by practitioners. In this study we address the problem of resource allocation under uncertainty by developing a counter-intuitive heuristic that is simple and effective. We developed a simulation tool allowing us to test resource allocation strategies in realistic environments. Surprisingly, the results demonstrate that resource allocation strategies with less than 100\% resource allocation in the planning stage enable an overall value for a project portfolio that is close to the ideal maximum. This means that managers should keep a certain percentage of resources in the planning stage idle to encounter variations in the execution phase, enabling a maximal project portfolio value.},

Expected net benefits were calculated for each of the organizational groups under different work profiles. Findings from the simulation suggest that not all conflict is realistic.

But overresponding to change has been cited as the source of many software disasters, such as the \$3 billion overrun of the US Federal Aviation Administration's Advanced Automation System for national air traffic control. The author believes that both agile and plan-driven approaches have a responsible center and overinterpreting radical fringes. Agile and plan-driven methods both form part of the planning spectrum. Thus, while each approach has a home ground within which it performs very well, and much better than the other, a combined approach is feasible and preferable in some circumstances.},

The conventional project control methods such as work breakdown structure and critical path method are very common in the construction industry. However, these linear processes do not allow for iterations and are being criticised for being inflexible, not being completely suitable for managing complex projects and not having the capability to take into account the cyclical process mainly due to their one-way progression manner. Nevertheless, the adoption of building information modelling (BIM) has provided the necessary infrastructure for adopting new iterative workflows including Agile management in general and its specific methods such as Scrum and Kanban. This chapter will explore the suitability of nonlinear project management methods for construction projects and how digital construction can play an important role in implementing them. It will then argue how design and construction firms can benefit from implanting Agile management to transform the way buildings are being designed and constructed by demanding feedback from a wide range of backgrounds more frequently. Finally, it will discuss the industry needs to further explore disruptive methods, examine and test them to unlock the potential benefits of implementing them.},

One important aspect of project management planning is scheduling. Scheduling includes recording human resources and tasks in the project. The Kanban method is one of the methods used to overcome problems in controlling project schedules. This study aims to develop a project scheduling system that applies the Kanban method. In this research, project management and scheduling system will be developed using the Kanban method. This system expected to be able to assist companies in handling projects. Kanban was chosen because it can easily respond to project changes, easily implemented, and company needs. In this study, unit testing was performed on the system's three main features and tested the validity of the system's 49 functional requirements. The usability test produces a value of 76. Based on the validation and usability test results, it can be concluded that the system is included in the acceptable category.},

	abstract = {This research introduces an influence diagram based approach to estimating task lead times for Agile Kanban project management. Derived from the principles of lean manufacturing, Agile methodologies including Scrum, Scrumban, and Kanban are common in the software industry and are spreading to other fields. Many teams estimate task delivery to better manage stakeholder expectations and improve decision making. However, the current technique involves calculating a team’s story point completion velocity, requiring hours of weekly effort while overlooking the addition, removal, and reprioritization of backlog tasks. While these factors may be critical in Scrum, teams practicing Kanban experience these conditions frequently due to the emphasis on continuous integration and reprioritization. Our alternative approach applies an influence diagram, or Bayesian belief network, to model the uncertainties affecting the lead time. To partially automate the estimation process, an influence diagram based expert system is developed and populated with data from a practicing Kanban team and used to generate a cumulative distribution function to facilitate the communication of probabilistic estimates. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to better understand how each factor influences lead times. This system can assist Kanban teams’ stakeholder communication and reduce estimation workload through a more holistic model of lead times.},

A linked queueing network model is developed to describe the behaviour of Kanban controlled systems. Next it is shown that the linked model is equivalent to multiple server queues in series with a blocking mechanism that depends on the features of the system. If there are reserve stocks in the system then the blocking mechanism is the conventional blocking of service because the next queue is full. However, if Kanbans can be triggered by backorders, then the blocking mechanism is more complex and requires looking at the number of customers in following stages. Next, it is shown that MRP systems are also equivalent to series queues but with the rules for determining release of jobs into service now involving forecasts of future demand. Based on the insights from the queueing models, a general approach to production control incorporating both Kanban and MRP systems as special cases is proposed.},

On the other hand, traditional, waterfall-like approaches are still very used in real-life software projects, due to the ease of up-front planning and budgeting, that however are seldom matched upon project completion. In our opinion, more effort is needed to study and model the inner structure and behavior of these approaches, highlighting positive and negative feedback loops that are strategic to understand their features, and to decide on their adoption. In this paper we analyze the dynamic behavior of the adoption of Kanban and Scrum, versus a traditional software development process such as the Waterfall approach. We use a system dynamics model, based on the relationships between system variables, to assess the relative benefits of the studied approaches. The model is simulated using a commercial tool. The proposed model visualizes the relationships among these software development processes, and can be used to study their relative advantages and disadvantages.},

Organizations involved in concurrent software development not only experience the dynamics common to single projects, but also face interactions between different releases of their product: they share resources among different stages of different projects, including customer support, they have a common code base and architecture that carries problems across releases, they use the same capabilities, and their market success in early releases impacts their resources in later ones. Drawing on two case studies we discuss some of the feedback processes central to concurrent software development and build a simple simulation model to analyze the resulting dynamics. This model sheds light on tipping dynamics, the nature of inter-project feedback loops, and alternative resource allocation policies relevant to management of concurrent software development.

Yet, while the potential costs and benefits of outsourcing are widely debated, a thorough understanding of the phenomenon remains elusive. The outsourcing decision is highly situational and generalizations regarding its relative merits are difficult to construct. Because of its unique ability to capture the inherent complexity of the outsourcing decision, system dynamics is used to construct a computer-based model of that decision process in a typical information systems organization. The effect of two management policies and two exogenous variables is explored over 80 quarters (20 years). Findings indicate that while outsourcing offers potential cost savings, it is accompanied by a decreased ability to respond to unexpected changes in the competitive market place.

Complexity has become an inseparable aspect of systems and also one of the important factors in the failure of projects. While much has been written about project complexity, there is still a lack of understanding of what constitutes project complexity. This research includes a systematic literature review to demonstrate the current understanding of commonalities and differences in the existing research. This was achieved by examining more than 420 published research papers, drawn from an original group of approximately 10,000, based on citations during the period of 1990–2015. As a result of this exploration, an integrative systemic framework is presented to demonstrate understanding of project complexity. It was found that there are three primary and distinctive models of project complexity, the Project Management Institute view, the System of Systems view and the view developed from the analysis of citations of research papers, which is called the Complexity Theories view. Further testing is required on a range of complex projects in order to attempt to reconcile these views.},

The paper demonstrates how portfolio management can be put into practice by applying the planning and control cycle of individual projects to trade off the interests of project leaders and department heads in a team effort. By coupling the planning and control cycles for single projects and the portfolio of projects, an overall framework is built to meet the multiproject challenge. In this framework, the project-breakdown structure and organization-breakdown structure are linked.

	title = {Dynamics of {Agile} {Software} {Development}},
	abstract = {Software projects have traditionally been problematic in terms of quality, cost and time. Researchers and practitioners have focused on agile software development as an alternative to overcome these problems. Agile methods employ iterative development cycles (typically 20 working-days), interspersed by user feedback. The key to agile projects is the sense of urgency created by the need to deliver at regular intervals. This paper examines this construct, i.e., schedule pressure. We investigate the relationship between the level of agility (length of the iterative cycle) and project outcomes. We argue that project outcomes may suffer either from a team being too inactive, e.g., in sequential or low levels of agility, or from a team being over-active over too long, a situation likely to occur in high levels of agility. We hypothesize that moderate levels of agility are likely to result in the best project outcomes. We test our hypothesis through simulation, and find a U-shaped pattern: performance is better when iteration lengths are 50 working-days, as opposed to 20 working-day cycles widely used in practice. Our analysis provides both theoretical insights into the dynamics of agile software development and practical suggestions for managing these projects.},

The history of modern process improvement can be traced at least to Shewhart. From his foundational process contributions and those of other innovators a variety of methods and tools to aid in process quality advancement were developed. This paper begins by reviewing those early steps and then focuses on the emergence of Maturity Models in the 1970s with initial approach by Nolan. The broad adoption of Maturity Models that followed through the success of the CMM and then the CMMI approaches is detailed. This then leads to a general survey of additional models developed for such areas as IT Service Management, ITIL, Project Management, Agile Development, DevOps, CERT, and MDM among others. Finally, this paper discusses the application of these models in the support of process improvement and their limitations. Readers of this paper can expect to gain an appreciation for the origins of these models and surrounding methods as well as an ability to conduct comparative analysis of such models to aid in their selection and application.

In our organization, 1 pre-/postexamination quality metric, namely, lost specimens, as tracked continuously for 27 years, has demonstrated steady improvement. During this period, many of our processes transitioned to highly automated effectors. Concurrently, we implemented behavioral controls and reengineered error-prone processes. We believe that this bilateral approach has conclusively lowered our lost specimen rates.Using data spanning 27 years, we plotted the correlation between lost specimens and the implementation dates for 8 major phases of automation, as well as 19 process improvements and engineering controls.The lost specimen rate decreased nearly 100-fold. In Six Sigma terms, the 12 month moving average for lost specimens currently hovers at approximately 5.94 sigma, with 11 months at or better than 6 sigma. Although the combination of implementation of process improvements, engineering controls, and automation contributed to the reduction, automation was the most significant contributor.The custom automation in use by our laboratory has led to improved pre-/postexamination quality. Although this automation may not be possible for all laboratories, our description of 19 behavior and engineering controls may be useful to others seeking to design high quality pre-/postexamination processes.},

Our approach consists of constructing a dynamic service delivery organization and developing a feedback control mechanism for dynamic workload management.

Service metrics are objectively measured, however, subjective criteria - those that depend on the subject (person) being polled - are not easily brought into the picture. Uncertainty is not typically considered in the measurement process. Service metrics are gathered strictly on an operational level without any effective information available at a strategic level. Within this scope of work, we propose a model in order to quantify an IT service aggregated value and a hierarchical quality indicator within a time snapshot, which can be used to help managers in activities relating to continual service improvement.

IaaS requires significant physical resources, e.g., network connections, bandwidth, load balancers, and servers. IaaS providers of any size and reach, but especially private and public regional ones, have to manage the capacity of their resources properly to reduce costs and meet other business goals. Comprehensive capacity management by IaaS providers involves objective and subjective analyses and it is thus, challenging. Complexity arises, for instance, as one tries to factor management behavior in analyses of business impact and infrastructure performance to produce indicators in support of interventions related to service capacity. IaaS managers frequently rely on their own expertise, experience, and knowledge to identify whether an apparent capacity deficiency may be due to an infrastructure problem or to an unexpected demand burst. This article presents a business-driven simulation model based on System Dynamics (SD), Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) concepts to support capacity management decisions by IaaS providers in real-life operating scenarios. A case study in a real-world, public regional IaaS provider illustrates the model’s support to non-trivial decisions that are aligned with managers’ experiences and business expectations.},

We show how dynamic systems theory could be usefully applied to maintenance and testing context, namely to model the dynamic evolution of the effort. When programmers start trying to recognize and correct code defects, while the number of residual defects decreases, the effort spent to find out any new defect has an initial increase, followed by a decline, in a similar way as prey and predator populations do.

This paper proposes to adopt queue theory to deal with an economically relevant category of problems: the staffing, the process management and the service level evaluation of massive maintenance projects in a virtual software factory. Data from a massive corrective maintenance intervention were used to simulate and study different service center configurations, in particular, a monolithic configuration and a configuration corresponding to a multi-phase maintenance process where several maintenance centers cooperated. Queue theory allowed effective control of the process supporting project management decisions. The mathematical tool provided a means to assess staffing, evaluate service level and balance the workload between maintenance centers while executing the project.},

The authors consulted 13 experts from Indian software outsourcing industry during the model construction and validation. Findings The simulation results show that the complexity of maintenance project has an insignificant effect on offshore migration. The maintenance work transfer should start with initial onsite team strength higher than that of required for ticket solving and project. The initial offshore team strength should be based on training capacity available at the onsite location. The higher attrition rate at an offshore is detrimental for offshore migration. Research limitations/implications The implication of the study is in the development of a broad framework of software maintenance work transfer to offshore locations for Indian software outsourcing projects. As the study is based on expert opinion in the context of India, it cannot be generalized for outsourcing scenarios elsewhere. Practical implications The software project manager can use the findings to get more insight into maintenance project offshore migration and divide the software team between onsite and offshore location. Originality/value The study is novel as there is little attempt at finding the manpower composition at onsite and offshore locations for software maintenance project during the migration phase.},

To address questions of meanings to the term “Agile,” we examine a range of Agile methods practiced and develop a framework of seven characteristics, which we call the Agile Genome. We gain insight into the dynamics of how Agile development compares to classic “waterfall” approaches by constructing a System Dynamics model for software projects. The Agile Project Dynamics (APD) model captures each of the Agile genes as a separate component of the model and allows experimentation with combinations of practices and management policies. Experimentation with the APD model is used to explore how different genes work in combination with one another to produce both positive and negative effects. The extensible design of the APD model provides the basis for further study of Agile methods and management practices.},

Effective allocation is difficult due to the inherent closed loop flow of development work and the dynamic demand patterns of work backlogs. The Resource Allocation Policy Matrix is proposed as a means of describing resource allocation policies in dynamic systems. Simple system dynamics and control theoretic models of resource allocation in a product development context are developed. The control theory model is used to specify a foresighted policy, which is tested with the system dynamics model. The benefits of foresight are found to reduce with increasing complexity. Process concurrence is found to potentially reverse the impact of foresight on project duration. The model structure is used to explain these results and future research topics are discussed.},

In this study we introduce a new rework cycle formulation that accounts for multiple defects per task and flexibly captures the testing process. We compare this formulation with two established formulations from the literature. Analysis shows some differences in simulated projects' finish time and delivered quality across different models and we discuss how these differences depend on project characteristics and task structure. The new formulation could be especially useful when data on tasks, defects, and testing have different measures, and when each new defect in a task significantly increases the chances of the task being rejected.

	abstract = {At present, companies are confronted with a rapidly changing environment that is characterized by high market pressure and technological development, which results in shorter delivery times, lower development costs, and increasingly complex business processes. Companies must be continuously prepared to adapt to changes to remain competitive and profitable. Thus, many companies are undergoing significant business process change (BPC) to increase business process flexibility and enhance their performance. Various researchers have advanced the domain of BPC over the last twenty years, proposing several managerial concepts, principles, and guidelines for BPC. However, many BPC projects still fail. BPC is seen as a complex endeavor, and its decisions are shaped by many dynamic and interacting factors that are difficult to predict. Thus, this paper proposes a system dynamics simulation model that conveys the complex relationships between important constructs in BPC. The resulting model is based on results compiled from 130 BPC case studies. BPC researchers can use the proposed model as a starting point for analyzing and understanding BPC decisions under different policy changes. Practitioners will obtain a ready-to-use simulation model to make various BPC decisions.},

CM is a support process that helps organizations have better management of their infrastructure. Its importance, in the Information Technology (IT) domain, has increased in recent years, despite this process not being technologically new, and the fact that many organizations implement this process in a haphazard way, which results in it not producing the benefits that it should produce. With the intention of assessing and improving the organizations’ IT processes practices and capabilities, MMs have been developed and implemented. However, the application of MM in the CM domain is yet to be explored. Design/Methodology/Approach: Two Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) and a Critical Analysis were performed. In sum, 80 scientific articles of the most rated conferences and scientific journals were analyzed and conclusions were drawn.
Results: This research concludes that despite the CM process being badly implemented, using a MM this process could decrease operational costs and increase the quality management of the infrastructure.
Conclusion: However, no MM has been developed so far for the CM process practices. This MM would be a viable support tool for the IT organizations providers since this would help organizations have a mature CM process and better control of their IT infrastructure. Therefore, the existence of a MM for the CM domain would be a welcome advancement that should be developed in the future.},

Inspired by the contrasting network strategies of FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS), we study when two service classes (e.g., express or regular) should be served by dedicated resources (e.g., air or ground) or by an integrated network (e.g., air also serves regular). Using call center terminology, the question is whether to operate two independent queues or one N-network. We present analytic expressions for the delay distributions and the value of network integration through partial resource pooling. These show how the value of network integration depends on service quality (speed and reliability of service) and demand characteristics (volume averages and covariance matrix). Our results suggest that network integration is of little value and operating dedicated networks is a fine strategy if the firm primarily serves express requests with high reliability and if the correlation with regular requests is not strongly negative. In contrast, network integration offers significant gains for firms serving primarily regular requests, almost independent of correlation. Our analysis provides the intuition behind these findings in terms of three main drivers of integration value: arrival pooling, the substitution effect, and the correlation effect.},

The following question is addressed: How many servers are required (staffing) and how does one match them with customers (control) to minimize staffing cost, subject to class-level quality-of-service constraints? We tackle this question by characterizing scheduling and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as system load grows to infinity. The asymptotic regimes considered are consistent with the efficiency-driven (ED), quality-driven (QD), and quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) regimes, first introduced in the context of a single-class service system. Our main findings are as follows: (a) Decoupling of staffing and control, namely, (i) staffing disregards the multiclass nature of the system and is analogous to the staffing of a single-class system with the same aggregate demand and a single global quality-of-service constraint, and (ii) class-level service differentiation is obtained by using a simple idle-server-based threshold-priority (ITP) control (with state-independent thresholds); and (b) robustness of the staffing and control rules: our proposed single-class staffing (SCS) rule and ITP control are approximately optimal under various problem formulations and model assumptions. Particularly, although our solution is shown to be asymptotically optimal for large systems, we numerically demonstrate that it performs well also for relatively small systems.},

Past research has focused on how to allocate a small amount of resources optimally but has scarcely explored how to foresee multiproject resource conflict risk in advance. The purpose of this study is to address this knowledge gap by developing a model to predict multiproject resource conflict risk. Design/methodology/approach A fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to transform subjective judgments into quantitative information, based on which an evaluation index system for multiproject resource conflict risk that focuses on the interdependence of multiple project resources is proposed. An artificial neural network (ANN) model combined with this system is proposed to predict the comprehensive risk score that can describe the severity of risk. Findings Accurately predicting multiproject resource conflict risks in advance can reduce the risk to the organization and increase the probability of achieving the project objectives. The ANN model developed in this paper by the authors can capture the essential components of the underlying nonlinear relevance and is capable of predicting risk appropriately. Originality/value The authors explored the prediction of the risks associated with multiproject resource conflicts, which is important for improving the success rate of projects but has received limited attention in the past. The authors established an evaluation index system for these risks considering the interdependence among project resources to describe the underlying factors that contribute to resource conflict risks. The authors proposed an effective model to forecast the risk of multiproject resource conflicts using an ANN. The model can effectively predict complex phenomena with complicated and highly nonlinear performance functions and solve problems with many random variables.},

The project management community accepted the proposed method as a viable alternative. However, to allow its implementation with a multiproject system, more research was necessary. Seeking to identify the key factors that influence the performance of the multiproject system applying the CCPM method, we performed a case study. Logistic regression analysis showed that applying the CCPM method in a multiproject system allows for better time estimation of activities and facilitates the allocation of critical resources.},

Meantime, a very important step in the process of decision is the assignment of human resources, particularly in connection with research and development (R\&D) projects in which the system is highly dependent on the capabilities of human resources. In this study, we tried all the assumptions that come true in the real world, considered a model for applied R\&D projects to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of projects. Therefore, an integrated multiproject scheduling and multiskill human resource assignment model under uncertainty has developed for R\&D projects. Furthermore, it is assumed that the activity processing time is related to human resources assignment that means the learning effect is considered. To demonstrate the proposed model efficiency, the various dimensions instance problem was solved accurately and efficiently in GAMS software, and the results have been reported. In addition, the proposed model is validated through the input parameter sensitivity analysis. The results indicate a suitable performance of the proposed fuzzy mathematical programming model is due to the complexity of the problem.},

	abstract = {The design process is difficult to accelerate due to its iterative nature, which increases project cost and delays completion time of a design project. Many previous studies tried to find the optimal structure and sequence of a design process minimizing iteration. In a multiproject environment, however, waiting time caused by resource shortage is a more critical reason for a lengthy project than iteration time. In this paper, we propose a novel sequencing method that reduces waiting time in a multiproject environment by dynamically changing the sequence of design tasks, according to availability of resources. It is called a dynamic sequencing method, as opposed to the traditional static sequencing method by which every design project follows a predefined optimal sequence. In order to evaluate the effect of this method, we developed a design-process model for simulating iteration and waiting in a multiproject environment. The simulation results show that dynamic sequencing is significantly better than traditional static sequencing with respect to average duration of projects. It is noted that more significant improvements can be obtained for the bottlenecked and unbalanced processes, both of which conditions would otherwise have negative effects on process performance.},

In this context, up to now, only little work has considered strategic targets for company skill levels. Hence, we present an optimisation model to address the problem of assigning project work to multi-skilled internal and external human resources while considering learning, depreciation of knowledge and company skill level targets. This constrained nonlinear continuous model is solved using COIN-OR's Ipopt. We assess the computation time and the impacts of problem parameters such as the shape of the learning curve, company skill level targets, depreciation of knowledge and cost parameters. Amongst other findings, our results show that faster learning of human resources leads to more specialised individuals while at the same time the whole company's knowledge is broadened.},

A typical situation entails a limited pool of resources which is applied to the management of several projects, with people moving back and forth among different assignments in different projects. Yet, few studies on project management have started to explore the issue of how to manage an organization with multiple inter- or intradepartmental projects. Using a case study method, our exploratory research investigates the specific problems associated with the management of multiple engineering projects in a manufacturing support environment, with the intent to identify common factors of success. Knowing the factors of success is but the first step toward improving multi-project management. Our findings provide insight into how the most important multiple-project success factors in this environment differ from factors of success in traditional single-project management, and are consistent with other emerging research in product development environments. The differences center on resource allocation and flexibility. Some factors, such as ownership, staff experience, and communication, take on additional dimensions when considered in a multiple-versus a single-project environment. Division and assignment of resources, prioritization, and customized management style, which have little relevance in relation to single projects, are shown to play a major role in the success of multiproject management.},

These perceptions of quality dimensions form the basis for a person's overall quality perception, which in turn predicts the person's intended behaviors. The authors first test this model with data from a longitudinal laboratory experiment. Then they develop a method for estimating the model with one-time survey data, and reestimate the model using such data collected in a field study. Empirical findings from the two tests of the model indicate, among other things, that the two different types of expectations have opposing effects on perceptions of service quality and that service quality perceptions positively affect intended behaviors.},

This problem can be resolved, at least partially, by combining SD modelling with already existing and commonly used static modelling methods, namely software process modelling and measurement-based quantitative modelling. To illustrate the feasibility of such a combination, in this paper, an approach is proposed that complements SD modelling with descriptive process modelling and goal-oriented measurement performed according to the principles of the well-established goal/question/metric (GQM) paradigm.

The use of system dynamics for strategic project management is illustrated with a case study of the Peace Shield Air Defense System. On this project, the model was used to support the project bid, to identify and manage risks, and to assess the benefit of several process and organization changes which were implemented on the project. Upon completion, the project results were systematically compared to an earlier project to assess the management lessons—what worked and what did not, and what was the benefit.

VDT simulates the micro-level information processing, communication, and coordination behavior of participants in a project organization and predicts several measures of participant and project-level performance. VDT-1 (Cohen 1991) and VDT-2 (Christiansen 1993) modeled project organizations containing actors with perfectly congruent goals engaged in complex but routine engineering design work within static organization structures. VDT-3 extends the VDT-2 work process representation to include measures of activity flexibility, complexity, uncertainty, and interdependence strength. It explicitly models the effects of goal incongruency between agents on their information processing and communication behavior while executing more flexible tasks. These extensions allow VDT to model more flexible organizations executing less routine work processes. VDT thus bridges rigorously between cognitive and social psychological micro-organization theory and sociological and economic macro-organization theory for project teams. VDT-3 has been used to model and simulate the design of two major subsystems of a complex satellite launch vehicle. This case study provides initial evidence that the micro-contingency theory embodied in VDT-3 can be used to predict organizational breakdowns, and to evaluate alternative organizational changes to mitigate identified risks.

VDT simulates the micro-level information processing, communication, and coordination behavior of participants in a project organization and predicts several measures of participant and project-level performance. VDT-1 (Cohen 1991) and VDT-2 (Christiansen 1993) modeled project organizations containing actors with perfectly congruent goals engaged in complex but routine engineering design work within static organization structures. VDT-3 extends the VDT-2 work process representation to include measures of activity flexibility, complexity, uncertainty, and interdependence strength. It explicitly models the effects of goal incongruency between agents on their information processing and communication behavior while executing more flexible tasks. These extensions allow VDT to model more flexible organizations executing less routine work processes. VDT thus bridges rigorously between cognitive and social psychological micro-organization theory and sociological and economic macro-organization theory for project teams. VDT-3 has been used to model and simulate the design of two major subsystems of a complex satellite launch vehicle. This case study provides initial evidence that the micro-contingency theory embodied in VDT-3 can be used to predict organizational breakdowns, and to evaluate alternative organizational changes to mitigate identified risks. VDT thus supports true "organizational engineering" for project teams.},

Quantifying these effects is important to project managers, in particular for effective communication with the client. Traditional planning and control tools have proved ineffective at providing quick and reliable information. Their tendency to incorporate more detail has increased their complexity, inhibiting practical strategic analyses. System Dynamics provides an alternative view in which these major influences are considered and quantified explicitly. This approach dispenses with much of the detail required by the traditional tools, but enables modelling of the systemic effects which traditional tools cannot model. The authors have developed a conceptual framework in which System Dynamics models are combined with traditional tools providing complementary support, and validated it in a large software project. This paper describes the use of this framework to assess and quantify the impacts of client behaviour. A practical example is discussed.},

There have been a number of applications of system dynamics in project management; this experience permits a tentative comparison with the more traditional approaches and to examine the particular benefits of system dynamics. The conflicts of opinion between their supporters stress the different perspectives underlying the two approaches. The comparison of the approaches is focused on the 'view' of the project management process. Although, ultimately, they both assume a system perpective, identifying a cycle of planning, implementation and control, the level of detail in which they consider the project system is different. Traditional models support the project manager in the detailed operational problems within the process, while system dynamics models provide more strategic insights and understanding about the effectiveness of different managerial policies.

An alternative view of the project is offered by system dynamics which concentrates on the whole project. The approach emphasises the interrelationships that may be responsible for unexpected overrun and overspend.

	abstract = {Context
Software and information system are everywhere and the projects involving them are becoming more complex. However, these projects performance patterns are not showing improvement or convergence over time. Additionally, there is a growing interest in modeling the complexities involved in such projects for evaluating long-term impacts, especially the dynamic dimension.
Objective
This study aims to analyze how the system dynamics approach has been used in the scientific literature to model complexity in software and information system projects.
Method
The research approach used was a mapping study that combined bibliometrics and content analysis to draw the scenario of the research literature related to software and information system projects, identifying patterns, evolution trends, and research gaps.
Results
The results show the focus of the studies analyzed regarding the step of policy design and evaluation in the modeling process (46\%), besides investigating software development projects (34\%). This study also reveals that the most employed tools are simulations (78\%) and the causal loop diagram (61\%), but only 37\% presented model equations. As for the software and information system projects success dimension, system quality has prevailed (73\%).
Conclusion
The mapping showed that there is a gap of studies exploring the implementation and post implementation phases of software and information systems. Few studies explored the social components; the majority of the studies focused on technical aspects and did not report the complete steps of system dynamics modeling development process. This lack of information hinders the reproduction of past results for expanding and developing new studies.},

	abstract = {Project managers often face the problem of how to evaluate the impact of schedule pressure on projects, and need to use overtime and overmanning to get work done on time when schedule pressure occurs. In a project, personnel fatigue, efficiency loss, quality problems and cost increases, which interact to be feedback loops, and the loops create a project's dynamics system. Some traditional methods, such as CPM, PERT, are inadequate to analyze how these variables interacted and can not determine the impact of schedule pressure on projects. And therefore, there is a need for a model to analyze the impact of schedule pressure on project systematically. In this paper, firstly, system dynamics is introduced to develop a model to analyze the impact of schedule pressure on project quantitatively. And then a case study is used to testify the validity of the model. Finally, this paper gives the analysis of the results of the model and discusses how projects are affected by schedule pressure. The system dynamics modeling approach offers a useful tool for evaluating the impact of schedule pressure on projects.},

	abstract = {Diffusion of innovations is a theory that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread. Everett Rogers, a professor of communication studies, popularized the theory in his book Diffusion of Innovations; the book was first published in 1962, and is now in its fifth edition (2003). Rogers argues that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated over time among the participants in a social system. The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines.
Rogers proposes that five main elements influence the spread of a new idea: the innovation itself, adopters, communication channels, time, and a social system. This process relies heavily on social capital. The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain. Within the rate of adoption, there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass. In 1989, management consultants working at the consulting firm Regis Mckenna Inc. theorized that this point lies at the boundary between the early adopters and the early majority. This tipping point between niche appeal and mass (self-sustained) adoption was originally labeled "the marketing chasm"The categories of adopters are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Diffusion manifests itself in different ways and is highly subject to the type of adopters and innovation-decision process. The criterion for the adopter categorization is innovativeness, defined as the degree to which an individual adopts a new idea.},

	abstract = {Service systems engineering (SSE) focuses on the systematic design and development of service systems. Guided by a value proposition, service systems enable value co-creation through a configuration of actors and resources (often including a service architecture, technology, information, and physical artifacts), therefore constituting complex socio-technical systems. IS research can play a leading role in understanding and developing service systems. SSE calls for research leading to actionable design theories, methods and approaches for systematically designing, developing and piloting service systems, based upon understanding the underlying principles of service systems. Three major challenges have been identified: engineering service architectures, engineering service systems interactions, and engineering resource mobilization, i.e. extending the access to and use of resources by means of IT. Researching SSE is challenging. Assessing the models, methods, or artifacts of SSE often requires embedded research within existing or even novel service systems. Consequently, approaches such as piloting IT-based innovations, design research or action research are the most promising for SSE research. As an integrative discipline, IS is in a unique position to spearhead the efforts in advancing the architecture, interaction, and resource base of service systems with evidence-based design.},

Task and outcome interdependence affected different aspects of group functioning: Tasks influenced variables related to cooperation, while outcomes influenced variables related to effort. Individuals' autonomy preferences did not moderate the effects of task and reward interdependence but, instead, were themselves influenced by the amount of interdependence in the work. These findings have implications for the design of work and reward systems for work groups.},

	abstract = {This is a comparative study of six organizations operating in the same industrial environment. The subsystems (sales, research, and production) in each organization were differentiated from each other in terms of subsystem formal structures, the member's goal orientation, member's time orientations and member's interpersonal orientations. This differentiation was related to the requirements of the particular subenvironment with which each subsystem dealt. A relationship was found between the extent to which the states of differentiation and integration in each organization met the requirements of the environment and the relative economic performance of the organizations. Within each organization the degree of differentiation of behavior and orientation between the various subsystems was found to be inversely related to the degree of integration obtained between these subsystems. Since this environment required that economically high performing organizations be both highly differentiated and well integrated, an investigation was also made into how effective organizations attained both of these antagonistic states. All six organizations had similar integrative devices (integrating teams and departments), but in the high performing organizations the integrative devices more fully met six determinants of effectiveness, which included such factors as the pattern of influence in the organization and the typical mode of behavior used to resolve conflict.},

We hypothesize that team interface management (a team-level function) performed in the concept phase of a project, rather than the later development phase, is positively related to team performance at the project's conclusion (i.e. product quality, product cost, development budget, development time). Furthermore, we argue that project structuring and support (a project-level function) is important in both the concept and the development phases. We test our hypotheses empirically based on a 36 months longitudinal study of a product development project in the European automotive industry comprising 39 teams. The results show that team interface management is particularly important during the concept phase of the project. Project structuring and support is most important in the development phase of the project, while hindering team performance in the concept phase. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

In the 1st section, theoretical roots of the multilevel perspective as it relates to theory building and research in organizations is reviewed. In the 2nd section, basic principles to guide multilevel theory development and to facilitate empirical research is clarified and synthesized.

Further, it shows how this research method can be applied in such diverse fields as urban affairs, social science, and public administration. Designing and Conducting Survey Research is an excellent tool that will help both professionals and students understand and explain the validity of sample survey research.  Praise for the Previous Edition of Designing \& Conducting Survey Research  "Clear, thorough, well-written, and eminently practical. Takes you step by step through all you need to know to conduct a survey or evaluate one and provides a basic understanding of the theoretical basis of sampling. The clarity of the book makes it a model for effective instruction and one that opens the road for those who must master the subject themselves." -Norton Long, professor emeritus of political science, University of Missouri, St. Louis  "A basic tool for conducting survey research projects that any researcher can understand and use. Freed of confusing statistical theory yet comprehensive in approach, with step by step details." -John B. Sauvajot, public management consultant and former deputy chief administrative officer, San Diego County  "Demystifies the arcane world of pollsters and survey research. Anyone who conducts surveys, hires survey consultants, reads reports, or makes policy based on survey data will benefit from this book." -Robert J. Waste, Survey Research Center, California State University, Chico},

The authors introduce MBSE as the state of the practice in the vital Systems Engineering discipline that manages complexity and integrates technologies and design approaches to achieve effective, affordable, and balanced system solutions to the needs of a customer organization and its personnel. The book begins with a summary of the background and nature of MBSE. It summarizes the theory behind Object-Oriented Design applied to complex system architectures. It then walks through the phases of the MBSE methodology, using system examples to illustrate key points. Subsequent chapters broaden the application of MBSE in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), real-time systems, cybersecurity, networked enterprises, system simulations, and prototyping. The vital subject of system and architecture governance completes the discussion. The book features exercises at the end of each chapter intended to help readers/students focus on key points, as well as extensive appendices that furnish additional detail in particular areas. The self-contained text is ideal for students in a range of courses in systems architecture and MBSE as well as for practitioners seeking a highly practical presentation of MBSE principles and techniques.},

	abstract = {Planning to deliver excellent service by balancing demand and supply in the context of a set of business policies is not an easy task. How an organisation dynamically deploys its resources and people in response to external demand determines how quickly an organisation can deliver service to its customers. To model this you need to represent the flows of work through the organisation, the resources available and the relationships between intake of work, outputs, workstacks and time-to-deliver. You also need to understand how flexible the organisation is in dealing with uncertain and fluctuating intakes and the policies the organisation adopts in deploying this flexibility. We have constructed a model of the operations of a telecommunications company that incorporates all of these elements using the system dynamics approach. This paper describes how the model is constructed and gives examples of how it can be used to explain observed behaviours. It also explains how it has been used to guide decision making on resource requirements and the optimum mix between proactive and reactive approaches to service assurance.},

The conclusion was that, even though the organization could improve work quality by using fewer staff members, poor coordination—regardless of number of staff—wiped out gains in quality, productivity, and speed.

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management. SDN is meant to address the static architecture of traditional networks. SDN attempts to centralize network intelligence in one network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network packets (data plane) from the routing process (control plane). The control plane consists of one or more controllers, which are considered the brain of the SDN network where the whole intelligence is incorporated. However, centralization has its own drawbacks when it comes to security, scalability and elasticity and this is the main issue of SDN.SDN was commonly associated with the OpenFlow protocol (for remote communication with network plane elements for the purpose of determining the path of network packets across network switches) since the latter's emergence in 2011. However, since 2012, proprietary  systems also used the term. These include Cisco Systems' Open Network Environment and Nicira's network virtualization platform.

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change the state of affairs of current networks, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. Today, SDN is both a hot research topic and a concept gaining wide acceptance in industry, which justifies the comprehensive survey presented in this paper. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbounds APIs, network virtualization layers, network operating systems, network programming languages, and management applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms -- with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security and dependability -- as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},

A data center typically houses a large number of computing and storage nodes, interconnected by a specially designed network, namely, data center network (DCN). The DCN serves as a communication backbone and plays a pivotal role in optimizing data center operations. However, compared to the traditional network, the unique requirements in the DCN, for example, large scale, vast application diversity, high power density, and high reliability, pose significant challenges to its infrastructure and operations. We have observed from the premium publication venues (e.g., journals and system conferences) that increasing research efforts are being devoted to optimize the design and operations of the DCN. In this paper, we aim to present a systematic taxonomy and survey of recent research efforts on the DCN. Specifically, we propose to classify these research efforts into two areas: i) DCN infrastructure and ii) DCN operations. For the former aspect, we review and compare the list of transmission technologies and network topologies used or proposed in the DCN infrastructure. For the latter aspect, we summarize the existing traffic control techniques in the DCN operations, and survey optimization methods to achieve diverse operational objectives, including high network utilization, fair bandwidth sharing, low service latency, low energy consumption, high resiliency, and etc., for efficient data center operations. We finally conclude this survey by envisioning a few open research opportunities in DCN infrastructure and operations.},

These disciplines can often work in isolation leading to inconsistencies in product information, tracking of design changes and challenges in decision-making. While literature proposes philosophical approaches to integrating these disciplines, there does not appear to be a practical approach offered.
The current study proposes a practical approach by way of a management flight simulator that integrates systems engineering and management models for data-driven risk-informed decision-making. This simulator provides immediate feedback on whether a change is going to help or disrupt design integrity through the monitoring of system attribute trends and cues. It also provides the impact on lifecycle management curves using a system dynamics sub-model.
From this feedback, several system, policy and process levers are available within the simulator for what-if scenarios with the goal to improve product, organizational and project performance. The value in the emergent properties of the simulator as a decision support system is viewed as greater than from the sum of its sub-models.
In developing the simulator, integration requirements, systems thinking, systems science and systems engineering practices are leveraged to develop an integration strategy. For bringing multiple disciplines together to address design changes risks, a response strategy is proposed that includes aspects of set-based goal-based design and agile management practices.},

	abstract = {The high cost of healthcare is a well-known topic. Utilizing systems engineering methods to address the problem is less well-known in the healthcare industry. There are many variables that impact the cost of healthcare, and this dissertation proposes a solution for the systemic problem of same day missed appointments. Healthcare systems have had success using Continuous Improvement (CI) tools and methods to change and improve processes, but the use of CI tools alone has not yet produced a sustained solution for same day missed appointments. Robust healthcare systems are driven by the architecture. Through utilization of the Model-Based Systems Architecture Process (MBSAP), an architecture was developed to automate utilization management and ultimately reduce the impact of same day missed appointments.
During the needs analysis phase of system development, the history of the problem at an outpatient imaging center was studied and initial experiments for system feasibility were performed. It was found that elements of the architecture are feasible but needed to be more fully developed before implementation. Benchmarking against other service-oriented industries provided additional context for the problem and a set of alternatives for subsystems within the architecture. These two efforts also resulted in the overarching system objective to create a solution that does not rely on changing patient behavior. Since the outpatient imaging center is a sociotechnical system, four social dimensions – the customer dimension, the planning dimension, the operations dimension, and the technical dimension – were defined and analyzed to find the right balance between alternative architectures for the diverse set of stakeholders needs. A subdomain that included the creation of a master dataset, a visual dashboard, and a predictive model was fully developed by integrating CI methodologies with MBSAP.
The proposed architecture includes automating the integration of the results of the predictive model with existing systems, but this piece of the architecture is still under development. In manually simulating how the results would change internal workflows to provide proactive targeted interventions, a 17\% improvement (\$260k) in the annual cost ({\textasciitilde}\$1.5M) of same day missed appointments for the outpatient imaging center was realized. MBSAP has been invaluable in adding systemic and systematic rigor to the complex real-world problem of same day missed appointments in an outpatient imaging center. The resulting systems architecture ensures that the needs of all stakeholders are met while anticipating potential unintended consequences.},

	abstract = {This study aims to address two major challenges faced at early stages of development, commonly called Pre-Phase A, for complex space-based mission architectures. The first challenge is a lack of detailed system information when an assessment of competing architecture concepts is needed. To counter this challenge, the Systems Operational Dependency Analysis and architecture-level parametric cost methods are used. These methods produce meaningful evaluation metrics for direct comparison of architecture concepts by utilizing both limited, high-level information as well as any detailed, low-level information that may be available. The second challenge is the ability to quickly and efficiently alter, add, or remove systems or system-attributes from a concept architecture and reevaluate using the afore mentioned methods. To counter this challenge, the Model Based Systems Engineering approach is utilized. With this approach, a single Mars concept architecture is created and quickly altered to include a second Mars variant. After that, the model is expanded to include two Moon-based variants followed by a connecting architecture with both lunar and martian missions. This task is demonstrated much more quickly than could have been possible using traditional, document-based systems engineering. The output of the tools is valuable to guide future research and concept evaluation. However, it is important to note the results are based on high-level information and expert opinion and do not claim a level of accuracy expected from Probabilistic Risk Assessment or industry-level cost methods. The focus of this study is the demonstration of a combination of tools to counter these two common challenges of early architecture development.},

Motivation for this research includes: 1) the lack of research that identifies modeling characteristics for complex system governance, 2) the lack of a framework rooted in systems theory to support performance of complex system governance functions for maintaining system viability.
This research focused on answering: What systems theoretic framework can be developed to inform complex system governance and enable articulation of governance function performance? The grounded theory research approach utilized three phases. First, the literature in systems theory, management cybernetics, governance and enterprise architecture was synthesized and open-coded to generalize main themes using broad analysis in NVivo software, researcher note taking in EndNote, and cataloging in Excel spreadsheets. Second, the literature underwent axial-coding to identify interconnections and relevance to systems theory and complex system governance, primarily using Excel spreadsheets. Finally, selective coding and interrelationships were identified and the complex system governance architecture framework was shaped, reviewed, and validated by qualified experts.
This research examined a grounded theory approach not traditionally used in systems theory research. It produced a useful systems theory based framework for practical application, bridging the gap between theory and practice in the emerging field of complex system governance.
Theoretical implications of this research include identifying the state of knowledge in each literature domain and the production of a unique framework for performing metasystem governance functions that is analytically generalizable. Management cybernetics, governance, and systems theory are expanded through a testable tool for meta-level organizational and system governance theories. Enterprise architecture is advanced with a multi-disciplinary framework that coherently presents and facilitates new use for architecture at the metasystem level.
Methodological implications of this research include using grounded theory approach for systems theory research, where it is atypical. Although a non-traditional method, it provides an example for conducting fruitful research that can contribute knowledge.
Practical implications of this research include a useable framework for complex system governance which has never before existed and a living structure adaptable to evolutionary change coming from any related domain or future practical application feedback.},

	abstract = {[EN] Modern data centers integrate a lot of computer and electronic devices. However, some reports state that the mean usage of a typical data center is around 50\% of its peak capacity, and the mean usage of each server is between 10\% and 50\%. A lot of energy is destined to power on computer hardware that most of the time remains idle. Therefore, it would be possible to save energy simply by powering off those parts from the data center that are not actually used, and powering them on again as they are needed.

Most data centers have computing clusters that are used for intensive computing, recently evolving towards an on-premises Cloud service model. Despite the use of low consuming components, higher energy savings can be achieved by dynamically adapting the system to the actual workload. The main approach in this case is the usage of energy saving criteria for scheduling the jobs or the virtual machines into the working nodes. The aim is to power off idle servers automatically. But it is necessary to schedule the power management of the servers in order to minimize the impact on the end users and their applications.

The objective of this thesis is the elastic and efficient management of cluster infrastructures, with the aim of reducing the costs associated to idle components. This objective is addressed by automating the power management of the working nodes in a computing cluster, and also proactive stimulating the load distribution to achieve idle resources that could be powered off by means of memory overcommitment and live migration of virtual machines. Moreover, this automation is of interest for virtual clusters, as they also suffer from the same problems. While in physical clusters idle working nodes waste energy, in the case of virtual clusters that are built from virtual machines, the idle working nodes can waste money in commercial Clouds or computational resources in an on-premises Cloud.},

	abstract = {Successful software development is becoming increasingly important to many companies. However, most projects fail to meet their targets, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional project management techniques in this unique setting. Despite breakthroughs in software engineering, management methodologies have not improved, and the major opportunities for better results are now in this area. Poor strategic management and related human factors have been cited as a major cause for failures, which traditional techniques cannot incorporate explicitly. System dynamics (SD) aims to model the behaviour of complex socio-economic systems; there has been a number of applications to software project management. SD provides an alternative view in which the major project influences are considered and quantified explicitly. Grounded on a holistic perspective it avoids consideration of the detail required by traditional tools, looking at the key aspects of the general project behaviour. However, if SD is to play a key role in software project management it needs to be embedded within the traditional decision-making framework. The authors developed a conceptual integrated model, the SYDPIM, which has been tested and improved within a large on-going software project. Such a framework specifies the roles of SD models, how they are to be used within the traditional management process, how they exchange information with the traditional models, and a general method to support model development.},

However, implementing DevOps can be a complex and challenging mission due it requires significant paradigm shift. Consequently, many failures and misconceptions can occur about DevOps adoption by organizations, despite its numerous benefits. This work identifies, describes, and compares different perspectives related to DevOps adoption in academy and industry. The perspectives can be understood as factors or variables that influence or help to understand the DevOps journey. We employed a sequential multi-method research approach, including Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Case Study. As a result, eight perspectives were found: concepts, models, principles, practices, difficulties, challenges, benefits, and strategies. More specifically, the SLR produced 390 items, which can be understood as occurrences of a perspective. The conducted case study confirmed 75 items, corroborating the SLR findings, while another 29 items emerged. This global view on DevOps adoption may guide beginners, both theorists, and practitioners, to make the necessary organizational transformation less painful.},

Microservice applications are developed by multiple DevOps teams each owning one or more services. In this article, we explore the state of how DevOps teams in small and medium-sized organizations (SMOs) cope with MSA and how they can be supported. We show through a secondary analysis of an exploratory interview study comprising six cases, that the organizational and technological complexity resulting from MSA poses particular challenges for small and medium-sized organizations (SMOs). We apply model-driven engineering to address these challenges. As results of the second analysis, we identify the challenge areas of building and maintaining a common architectural understanding, and dealing with deployment technologies. To support DevOps teams of SMOs in coping with these challenges, we present a model-driven workflow based on LEMMA—the Language Ecosystem for Modeling Microservice Architecture. To implement the workflow, we extend LEMMA with the functionality to (i) generate models from API documentation; (ii) reference remote models owned by other teams; (iii) generate deployment specifications; and (iv) generate a visual representation of the overall architecture. We validate the model-driven workflow and our extensions to LEMMA through a case study showing that the added functionality to LEMMA can bring efficiency gains for DevOps teams. To develop best practices for applying our workflow to maximize efficiency in SMOs, we plan to conduct more empirical research in the field in the future.},

	doi = {10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369580},
	abstract = {The software-defined data center (SDDC) concept replaces the older, scattered and disorganized silo-based architecture. The SDDC adoption implies the reduction of expenses with staff management and the infrastructure improvement, which becomes easier-to-keep, due mainly to the possibility to virtualize all these computational resources. Also, due to the components standardization, the required physical space to store, provide and maintain these environments have decreased. But a problem still remains, how to keep the system and service provisioning working under a stringent Service Level Agreement (SLA)? High Available (HA) environments have an annual downtime of fewer than five minutes; this is the closest that one can reach from a 100\% of availability, usually many layers of redundancy are required to achieve this value. This paper evaluates the hyper-convergence, one of the ways to reach HA in cloud computing environments, but with fewer components than typical architectures. The hyper-convergence on OpenStack cloud computing platform utilizes a distributed storage mechanism to reduce the expenses with storage devices. To the proposed environments evaluation, some behavioral models were created, these models show how advantageous are distributed storage systems over typical ones. The availability results pointed out that the full triple redundancy environment availability values are pretty close to the ones extracted from a hyper-convergent environment even with 33\% more components.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of processing and storage technologies and the success of the Internet, computing resources have become cheaper, more powerful and more available than ever before. This technological trend has enabled the realization of a new computing model called cloud computing, in which resources are provided as general utilities that can be leased and released by users through the Internet in an on-demand fashion. The organizations are gaining more experience in the cloud and they start to shift more core business functions onto cloud platforms. Because of this fact, we are seeing that cloud adoption is significantly more complex than we imagined initially, particularly in terms of data management, system integration and the management of multiple cloud providers. Cloud computing is of growing interest to companies around the globe, but many are finding greater costs and greater obstacles to the adoption of cloud computing than they anticipated. In this case, is cloud computing still able to deliver all the promises? In this paper we will analyze from a company's point of view the factors that need to be considered by an enterprise when making the decision of using cloud computing. Some of the companies are moving towards cloud computing just because it is the latest trend in information technology. On the other hand, other companies cannot even take into consideration the idea of having their sensitive data outside their premises. Both of these cases represent companies that are just not very well informed. We are not sustaining that cloud computing is a perfect solution for everybody, but adopting it or not should be result of a very well informed analysis. We will analyze the positive and negative aspects of each of the following factors: integration with existing IT infrastructure and existing software, costs, return on investment, performances, security. Also, we will correlate all these factors with the company size and business area in order to identify if or what type of cloud computing solution is suitable for their needs.},

The amount of work involved with such maintenance, as well as the size and complexity of infrastructure specification files, have not yet been studied empirically. Through an empirical study of the version control system of 265 Open Stack projects, we find that infrastructure files are large and churn frequently, which could indicate a potential of introducing bugs. Furthermore, we found that the infrastructure code files are coupled tightly with the other files in a project, especially test files, which implies that testers often need to change infrastructure specifications when making changes to the test framework and tests.},

Yet, there exist many reasons to extend the Internet, e.g., for improving intra-domain and inter-domain routing for high availability of the network, providing end-to-end connectivity for users, and allowing dynamic QoS management of network resources for new applications, such as data center, cloud computing, and network virtualization. To address these requirements, the next-generation architecture for the Future Internet has introduced the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). At the core of this emerging paradigm is the separation and centralization of the control plane from the forwarding elements in the network as opposed to the distributed control plane of existing networks. This decoupling allows deployment of control plane software components (e.g., OpenFlow controller) on computer platforms that are much more powerful than traditional network equipment (e.g., switches/routers) while protecting the data and intellectual property of the vendors of such equipment. A critical understanding of this emerging paradigm is necessary to address the multiple challenges in realizing the Future Internet and to resolve the ossification problem of the existing Internet. To address these requirements, this paper surveys existing technologies and the wide range of recent and state-of-the-art projects on SDN followed by an in-depth discussion of the major challenges in this area.},

	abstract = {Next generation cloud systems will require a paradigm shift in how they are constructed and managed. Conventional control and management platforms are facing considerable challenges regarding flexibility, dependability and security that next generation systems must handle. The cloud computing technology has already contributed in alleviating a number of the problems associated with resource allocation, utilization and management. However, many of the elements of a well-designed cloud environment remain “stiff” and hard to modify and adapt in an integrated fashion. This includes the underlying networking topologies, many aspects of the user control over IaaS, PaaS or SaaS layers, construction of XaaS services, provenance and meta-data collection, to mention but few. In many situations the problem may be due to inadequacy of service abstraction. Software Defined Systems (SDSys) is a concept that help abstract the actual hardware at different layers with software components; one classical example of this abstractions are hypervisors. Such abstraction provides an opportunity for system administrators to construct and manage their systems, more easily, through flexible software layers. SDSys is an umbrella for different software defined subsystems including Software Defined Networking (SDN), Software Defined Storage (SDStorage), Software Defined Servers (Virtualization), Software Defined Data Centers (SDDC), Software Defined Security (SDSec) etc. and ultimately Software Defined Clouds (SDCloud). Individual solutions and seamless integration of these different abstractions remains in many respects a challenge. In this paper, the authors introduce Software Defined Cloud (SDCloud), a novel software defined cloud management framework that integrates different software defined cloud components to handle complexities associated with cloud computing systems. The first part of paper presents, for the first time, an extensive state of the art critical review of different components of software defined systems, constructing the proposed SDCloud. The second part of the paper proposes the novel concept of SDCloud, which is implemented and evaluated for its feasibility, flexibility and potential superiority.},

	abstract = {Context: Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the practice to automatically configure system dependencies and to provision local and remote instances. Practitioners consider IaC as a fundamental pillar to implement DevOps practices, which helps them to rapidly deliver software and services to end-users. Information technology (IT) organizations, such as GitHub, Mozilla, Facebook, Google and Netflix have adopted IaC. A systematic mapping study on existing IaC research can help researchers to identify potential research areas related to IaC, for example defects and security flaws that may occur in IaC scripts. Objective: The objective of this paper is to help researchers identify research areas related to infrastructure as code (IaC) by conducting a systematic mapping study of IaC-related research. Method: We conduct our research study by searching five scholar databases. We collect a set of 31,498 publications by using seven search strings. By systematically applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, which includes removing duplicates and removing non-English and non peer-reviewed publications, we identify 32 publications related to IaC. We identify topics addressed in these publications by applying qualitative analysis. Results: We identify four topics studied in IaC-related publications: (i) framework/tool for infrastructure as code; (ii) adoption of infrastructure as code; (iii) empirical study related to infrastructure as code; and (iv) testing in infrastructure as code. According to our analysis, 50.0\% of the studied 32 publications propose a framework or tool to implement the practice of IaC or extend the functionality of an existing IaC tool. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that framework or tools is a well-studied topic in IaC research. As defects and security flaws can have serious consequences for the deployment and development environments in DevOps, we observe the need for research studies that will study defects and security flaws for IaC.},

Due to its increasing interest and imprecise definitions, existing research works have tried to characterize DevOps. Nevertheless, little is known about the practitioners’ understandingabout successful paths for DevOps adoption. Therefore, our goal is to detail real scenarios of DevOps adoption, presenting a theory, a model, and a case study. We used classic Grounded Theory to build a theory about 15 scenarios of successful DevOps adoption in companies from different domains and countries. We proposed a model (i.e., a workflow for DevOps adoption) and evaluated it through a case study at a Brazilian Government institution. We used a focus group to collect the company perceptions about DevOps adoption. This paper increments the existing view of DevOps by detailing real scenarios and explaining the role of each category during DevOps adoption. We provide evidence that collaboration is the core DevOps concern, contrasting with an existing wisdom that automation and tooling can be enough to achieve DevOps. Altogether, our results contribute to: generating an adequate understanding of DevOps, from the practitioners’ perspective; and assisting other institutions in the path towards DevOps adoption.},

In this paper, we firstly discuss the changing cloud infrastructure and consider the use of infrastructure from multiple providers and the benefit of decentralising computing away from data centers. These trends have resulted in the need for a variety of new computing architectures that will be offered by future cloud infrastructure. These architectures are anticipated to impact areas, such as connecting people and devices, data-intensive computing, the service space and self-learning systems. Finally, we lay out a roadmap of challenges that will need to be addressed for realising the potential of next generation cloud systems.},

Low quality IaC scripts can have serious consequences, potentially leading to wide-spread system outages and service discrepancies. The goal of this research is to help practitioners increase the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by identifying anti-patterns in IaC scripts and development of IaC scripts. Using open source repositories, we conduct three initial studies to (i) quantify the frequency and categorize the defects in IaC scripts; and (ii) identify operations that characterize defective IaC scripts. Based on our empirical analysis we observe (i) the dominant defect defect categories to be related to syntax and configuration assignments, and (ii) three operations that characterize defective IaC scripts. The above-mentioned findings motivate us to identify anti-patterns in IaC scripts and IaC development. To this end, we propose three studies that identify (i) process anti-patterns; and (ii) security-related anti-patterns in IaC.},

	abstract = {Against the backdrop of new economic realities, one of the larger forces that is affecting businesses worldwide is cloud computing, whose benefits include agility, time to market, time to capability, reduced cost, renewed focus on the core and strategic partnership with the business. Cloud computing can potentially transform a majority of the information technology (IT) industry into services oriented IT organizations or simply IT as a Service (ITaaS), changing the way software and hardware are designed and purchased (Armbrust et al., 2009). Cloud computing model promotes availability apart from other benefits and is comprised of 5 essential characteristics like on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid and responsive elasticity and measured service (Perez et al., 2009). Effectiveness of IT is known as the degree to which IT can effectively and efficiently deliver and/or integrate with the technology based services and solutions. Strategic alignment is viewed as a bridge that links IT to different viewpoints on other domains of an organization and its environment (Avila, Goepp, \& Kiefer, 2009). This study is a modification and an extension of Ness's (2005) research, replacing IT flexibility with cloud adoption and extending to all IT organizations irrespective of their type and size. The study findings provided statistical evidence that cloud adoption has a very strong positive correlation on IT effectiveness and its relationship is much higher than the combination of the interaction of cloud adoption and strategic alignment (SA) which in turn has a higher correlation than the individual relationship of SA on IT effectiveness.

	abstract = {The issue of businesses understanding "cloud adoption" exists, despite the diverse academic research on cloud adoption. The various approaches (business and technical), theories (Technology-Organization-Environment, Transaction cost theory, Resource based view) have resulted in a fragmented and piece-meal approach to understanding cloud adoption. The purpose of this article is to review and consolidate the diverse literature on cloud adoption. This can help organizations decide their cloud readiness and understand the business implications from multiple perspectives. The paper begins with a focused review of existing literature on cloud adoption. The articles in the literature are then systematically classified on various parameters such as the perspective used (business versus technical), the dominant theory used and the adoption factors that are identified. Two existing frameworks are also critiqued to highlight their strengths and limitations. Finally, a short check list based on the cumulative findings is prepared. The review reveals common themes in terms of examining cloud adoption. It shows that cloud adoption has been primarily examined from the innovative technology perspective using the Technology-Organization-Environment framework. The two other dominant approaches that come up include the economic/cost perspective driven by transaction cost theory and the use of multi-criteria decision framework. The article contributes by reviewing and consolidating the diverse literature on the topic of cloud adoption. The study organizes the recurrent themes in the reviewed articles in terms four important areas. Within each area, the study also provides some commonly asked questions that could help organizations understand their readiness to adopt cloud. This way, the article integrates different perspectives and provides organizations with a simple, holistic check list to examine business implications of moving to cloud.},

With the advent of new technology new business models are being incorporated to host the applications on the Web as services. These Web services are being designed to be automatically discovered by software agents and exchange data among themselves. Cloud computing model, which has gained a lot of attention, in which hardware, software, tools, and applications are given out as services to users across the globe over the Internet for very low cost or no cost at all. There are many advantages of this cloud computing business model, as it requires very low capital expenditure, it has higher speed of application deployment to market, low cost of operation, and easy maintenance of the software services. Because of these advantages, cloud may soon become the most prevalent computing platform. The traditional engineering practices were not made keeping cloud computing platform in mind. To get the best of the all the advantages of cloud computing, we need to change the traditional way of software engineering. This paper, focus on how cloud computing, is going to influence the traditional software engineering processes to develop quality software and how we adapt the traditional software engineering process to cloud computing environment.},

The data center and cloud computing technologies have been at the moment rendering attention to major research and development efforts by companies, governments, and academic and other research institutions. In that, the difficult task is to facilitate the infrastructure to construct the information available to application-driven services and make business-smart decisions. On the other hand, the challenges that remain are the provision of dynamic infrastructure for applications and information anywhere. Further, developing technologies to handle private cloud computing infrastructure and operations in a completely automated and secure way has been critical. As a result, the focus of this article is on service and infrastructure life cycle management. We also show how cloud users interact with the cloud, how they request services from the cloud, how they select cloud strategies to deliver the desired service, and how they analyze their cloud consumption.},

	abstract = {While the rapid growth of cloud computing is driven by the surge of big data, the Internet of Things, and social media applications, an evaluation and investment decision for cloud computing has been challenging for corporate managers due to a lack of proper decision models. This paper attempts to identify critical variables for making a cloud capacity decision from a corporate customer’s perspective and develops a base mathematical model to aid in a hybrid cloud investment decision under probabilistic computing demands. The identification of the critical variables provides a means by which a corporate customer can effectively evaluate various cloud capacity investment opportunities. Critical variables included in this model are an actual computing demand, the amount of private cloud capacity purchased, the purchase cost of the private cloud capacity, the price of the public cloud, and the default downtime loss/penalty cost. Extending the base model developed, this paper also takes into consideration the interoperability cost incurred in cloud bursting to the public cloud and derives the optimal investment. The interoperable cloud systems require time and investment by the users and/or cloud providers and there exists a diminishing return on the investment. Hence, the relationship between the interoperable cloud investment and return on investment is also investigated.},

	abstract = {The level of difficulty that can be envisioned in a cloud data center will not grow with convention. As a result, all hosts should have a standard and pervasive collection of memory and communication characteristics in order to lower ownership costs and operate virtual machine instances. This solution includes fundamental foundations and integrated component basics that will allow an IT or federal agency to embrace cloud computing domestically via private virtual cloud data centers. These private cloud data centers would later be developed to purchase and develop IT services on the outside. They are well aware of the obstacles to cloud computing’s acceptance, including concerns about credibility, privacy, interoperability, and marketplaces. In addition, this procedure describes critical standards and collaborations to address these issues. Ultimately, it offers a coherent response to deploying safe data centers using cloud computing services from both a technological and an IT strategic standpoint. To foster creativity, invention, learning, and enterprise, a private data center and cloud computing must be established to combine the activities of different research teams. In the framework of energy-efficient distribution of resources in private cloud data center architecture, we focus on system structure investigations. On the other hand, we want to equip private cloud providers with the current design and performance analysis for energy-efficient resource allocation. The methodology should be adaptable enough to support a wide range of computing systems, as well as on-demand and extensive resource providing approaches, cloud environment scheduling, and bridging the gap between private cloud users and a complete image of offers.},

	abstract = {Background: The adoption of cloud services can enable enterprises to realise improved cost structures, agility and productivity, yet the rate of adoption has been measured. Despite the benefits of cloud computing and the fact that the overall adoption of public cloud services is gaining momentum, South African large enterprises are cautious in adopting the services of cloud service providers because of perceived challenges of cloud adoption.
Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine how do South African large enterprises assess and advance their cloud readiness and maturity such that cloud service practices contribute positively to business efficiency and agility whilst mitigating against the perceived risks of cloud computing.
Method: This research employed a qualitative approach using in-depth interviews. Sixteen South African large enterprise cases were studied by interacting with respondents associated with cloud decision-making. Data were collected from specific cases, utilising non-probability sampling.
Results: Reinvention of the organisation can be enabled through the advanced, integrated cloud and analytic features available through the global public cloud providers such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. A cloud maturity framework and a cloud capability maturity model to optimise and advance cloud maturity status are presented.
Conclusion: This article guides information technology (IT) managers to achieve an optimal cloud maturity status level using a proposed cloud capability maturity model. The cloud framework developed in this study will assist IT managers and decision-makers to use evidence-based management principles to determine their maturity of cloud adoption.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of cloud computing (involving storage and processing of data on the internet) in health care has increasingly been highlighted as having great potential in facilitating data-driven innovations. Although some provider organizations are reaping the benefits of using cloud providers to store and process their data, others are lagging behind.
Objective: We aim to explore the existing challenges and barriers to the use of cloud computing in health care settings and investigate how perceived risks can be addressed.
Methods: We conducted a qualitative case study of cloud computing in health care settings, interviewing a range of individuals with perspectives on supply, implementation, adoption, and integration of cloud technology. Data were collected through a series of in-depth semistructured interviews exploring current applications, implementation approaches, challenges encountered, and visions for the future. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed using NVivo 12 (QSR International). We coded the data based on a sociotechnical coding framework developed in related work.
Results: We interviewed 23 individuals between September 2020 and November 2020, including professionals working across major cloud providers, health care provider organizations, innovators, small and medium-sized software vendors, and academic institutions. The participants were united by a common vision of a cloud-enabled ecosystem of applications and by drivers surrounding data-driven innovation. The identified barriers to progress included the cost of data migration and skill gaps to implement cloud technologies within provider organizations, the cultural shift required to move to externally hosted services, a lack of user pull as many benefits were not visible to those providing frontline care, and a lack of interoperability standards and central regulations.
Conclusions: Implementations need to be viewed as a digitally enabled transformation of services, driven by skill development, organizational change management, and user engagement, to facilitate the implementation and exploitation of cloud-based infrastructures and to maximize returns on investment.},

Enabling IIoT applications in cloud environments requires the design of appropriate IIoT Platform as-a-Service (IIoT PaaS) to support and ease their provisioning (i.e., development, deployment and management). This paper critically reviews the IIoT PaaS architectures proposed so far in the relevant literature. It only surveys the architectures that are suitable for IIoT applications provisioning and it excludes regular IoT solutions from its scope. The evaluation is based on a set of well-defined architectural requirements. It also introduces and discusses the future challenges and the research directions. The critical review discusses the PaaS solutions that focus on the whole spectrum of IoT verticals and also the ones dealing with specific IoT verticals. Existing limitations are identified and hints are provided on how to tackle them. As critical research directions, the mechanisms that enable the secure provisioning, and IIoT PaaS interaction with virtualized IoT Infrastructure as-a-Service (IaaS) and fog computing layer are discussed.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing as a technology has the capacity to enhance cooperation, scalability, accessibility, and offers discount prospects using improved and effective computing, and this capability helps organizations to stay focused. Ontologies are used to model knowledge. Once knowledge is modeled, knowledge management systems can be used to search, match, visualize knowledge, and also infer new knowledge. Ontologies use semantic analysis to define information within an environment with interconnecting relationships between heterogeneous sets. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on ontology in cloud computing and defines the state of the art. We applied the systematic literature review (SLR) approach and identified 400 articles; 58 of the articles were selected after further selection based on set selection criteria, and 35 articles were considered relevant to the study. The study shows that four predominant areas of cloud computing—cloud security, cloud interoperability, cloud resources and service description, and cloud services discovery and selection—have attracted the attention of researchers as dominant areas where cloud ontologies have made great impact. The proposed methods in the literature applied 30 ontologies in the cloud domain, and five of the methods are still practiced in the legacy computing environment. From the analysis, it was found that several challenges exist, including those related to the application of ontologies to enhance business operations in the cloud and multi-cloud. Based on this review, the study summarizes some unresolved challenges and possible future directions for cloud ontology researchers.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which there is a relationship between perceived security, regulatory environment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use on the adoption of cloud computing by IT managers. The technology acceptance model is the theoretical foundation guiding the research. Cloud computing is the use of network-based remote servers available over the Internet to store, manage, and process data, available from anywhere in the world. Cloud computing expected to reach one trillion in IT expenditures, allocated to the transition to cloud migration services. With the constant growth of cloud computing and the need for an organization to adopt this innovation, the objective of this research is to demonstrate the effect of perceived security, regulatory environment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use on the adoption of cloud computing by IT managers. The outcome of this study is to help technology cloud service providers understand the variables of end-users that may be less inclined to adopt cloud computing, so they can foster appropriate marketing and corrective actions required to target these individuals. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is the underpinning theoretical framework used for this quantitative, nonexperimental, correlational research study. The study attempts to answer four research questions as to what degree or extent perceived security, regulatory environment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use predict cloud adoption. Descriptive and multiple regression inferential statistics, including the Pearson correlation coefficient, used for the data analysis. The target population for this study was IT managers over 21 years old. Hsu and Lin’s 2016 survey instrument used in this study extended on Davis’s 1989 technology acceptance model. The results of the correlation analysis showed a statistically significant positive correlation between perceived security, regulatory environment, and perceived usefulness on the adoption of cloud computing. The results of the correlation analysis showed a relationship between perceived ease of use and cloud adoption, but the result was not statistically significant. The results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that cloud service providers must address perceived security, regulatory environment, and perceived usefulness in order to promote the widespread adoption of technology innovation.},

	abstract = {With the continued appeal and adoption of cloud computing, an assessment of cloud run costs and migration affordability prior to adoption would assist enterprises that have several legacy applications targeted for cloud migration. However, as cloud migrations have become more prevalent, many have been characterised by unsuccessful migration or application modernisation attempts. The primary reason behind the failed attempts is insufficient planning upfront, to identify which legacy applications are suitable to realise the benefits of public or private cloud, leading to time and cost overruns. There is a need for strategic decision making for application portfolios to mitigate the risks of cost overruns and migration delays. Thus, a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cloud run costs for an application portfolio is required in the planning phase as an input into IT governance. To obtain the ROM cloud run costs, it is necessary to baseline application data, preferably through automated discovery, and perform quantitative analysis of the applications. Therefore, we propose an approach to (a) baseline application data using Application Portfolio Profiling (APP), and (b) perform quantitative analysis of applications using an Application Portfolio Assessment (APA), to inform the legacy application migration decision. APP and APA are proposed as part of a Cloud Computing Considerations for Companies (CCCC) framework that enables an enterprise to make an informed decision regarding which legacy applications are to be migrated as part of enterprise Cloud Computing adoption. This decision is important because of the change in operating model, infrastructure requirements, hidden costs and commercial models inherent with cloud computing adoption. We validate the proposed framework through applying it to a real-world use case scenario that provides the necessary coverage to test the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Clouds and MapReduce have shown themselves to be a broadly useful approach to scientific computing especially for parallel data intensive applications. However they have limited applicability to some areas such as data mining because MapReduce has poor performance on problems with an iterative structure present in the linear algebra that underlies much data analysis. Such problems can be run efficiently on clusters using MPI leading to a hybrid cloud and cluster environment. This motivates the design and implementation of an open source Iterative MapReduce system Twister. Comparisons of Amazon, Azure, and traditional Linux and Windows environments on common applications have shown encouraging performance and usability comparisons in several important non iterative cases. These are linked to MPI applications for final stages of the data analysis. Further we have released the open source Twister Iterative MapReduce and benchmarked it against basic MapReduce (Hadoop) and MPI in information retrieval and life sciences applications. The hybrid cloud (MapReduce) and cluster (MPI) approach offers an attractive production environment while Twister promises a uniform programming environment for many Life Sciences applications. We used commercial clouds Amazon and Azure and the NSF resource FutureGrid to perform detailed comparisons and evaluations of different approaches to data intensive computing. Several applications were developed in MPI, MapReduce and Twister in these different environments.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing adoption provides various advantages for companies. In particular, hybrid cloud shares the advantages of both the public and private cloud technologies because it combines the private in-house cloud with the public on-demand cloud. In order to obtain benefits from the opportunities provided by the hybrid cloud, organizations want to adopt or develop novel capabilities. Maturity models have proved to be an exceptional and easily available method for evaluating and improving capabilities. However, there is a dire need for a robust framework that helps client organizations in the adoption and assessment of hybrid cloud. Therefore, this research paper aims to present a taxonomy of the challenging factors faced by client organizations in the adoption of hybrid cloud. Typically, such a taxonomy is presented on the basis of obtained results from the empirical analysis with the execution of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. From the review of literature and empirical study, in total 13 challenging factors are recognized and plotted into four groups: “Lack of Inclination,” “Lack of Readiness,” “Lack of Adoption,” and “Lack of Satisfaction.” The AHP technique is executed to prioritize the identified factors and their groups. By this way, we found that “Lack of Adoption” and “Lack of Satisfaction” are the most significant groups from the identified challenging factors. Findings from AHP also show that “public cloud security concern” and “achieving QoS” are the upper ranking factors confronted in the adoption of hybrid cloud mechanism by client organizations because their global weight (0.201) is greater than those of all the other reported challenging factors. We also found out 46 practices to address the identified challenges. The taxonomy developed in this study offers a comprehensive structure for dealing with hybrid cloud computing issues, which is essential for the success and advancement of client and vendor organizations in hybrid cloud computing relationships.},

	abstract = {High uncertainties related to cloud computing adoption may hinder IT managers from making solid decisions about adopting cloud computing. The problem addressed in this study was the lack of understanding of the relationship between factors related to the adoption of cloud computing and IT managers' interest in adopting this technology. In this quantitative survey study, an online survey was administered to a stratified random sample of 221 IT decision makers from different U.S. industries. Pearson "r" and multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between the dependent variable (IT managers' interest in adopting cloud computing) and the independent variables (relative advantage, compatibility, organizational size, organizational readiness, top management support, mimetic pressure, coercive pressure, normative pressures). Pearson correlation statistics revealed statistically significant positive correlations between the dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable was positively correlated with relative advantage, r(219) = 0.604, p {\textless} 0.01, with compatibility, r(219) = 0.780, p {\textless}0.01, with organizational readiness, r(219) = 0.176, p {\textless}0.01, with top management support, r(219) = 0.749, p {\textless}0.01, with mimetic pressure, r(219) = 0.524, p {\textless}0.01, with coercive pressure, r(219) = 0.405, p {\textless}0.01, and with normative pressure, r(219) = 0.448, p {\textless}0.01. The results of multiple regression analysis demonstrated that compatibility, ß = 0.424, t(212) = 6.51, p {\textless}0.001, top management support, ß = 0.292,t(212) = 4.55, p {\textless}0.001, relative advantage, ß= 0.152, t(212) = 2.76, p {\textless}0.01, and mimetic pressure, ß = 0.130, t(212) = 2.25, p {\textless}0.05, were the most statistically significant factors that contributed to IT managers' interest in adopting cloud computing. These four factors also explained a significant proportion of variance in the dependent variable, R[superscript 2] = 0.69, F (8, 212) = 59.21, p {\textless}0.001. Recommendations for future studies include conducting research outside the United States to potentially improve and generalize the findings. Scholars can use this study to guide future research and to gain a more holistic understanding of cloud computing adoption. Researchers should delve more deeply into the cultural, legal, and compliance dimensions on the adoption of cloud computing. Practitioners can use this study to proactively design strategies targeted at organizations that may be less inclined to adopt cloud computing.

	abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) may be the most significant development in recent history for businesses seeking to utilize technology. However, the adoption of CC hinges on many factors, and can have a greater positive impact on organizational performance. This study examined the different factors that contribute to the resistance to CC adoption. Anchored in The Theory of Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE), the study used a qualitative, grounded theory approach to develop a theoretical model for the acceptance of CC across firms. CC can have significant effects on efficiency and productivity for firms, but these effects will only be realized if IT usage becomes utilized globally. Thus, it was essential to understand the determinants of IT adoption, which was the goal of this research. The central research question involved understanding and examining the factors of resistance that contribute to cloud computing adoption across firms. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 22 chief information officers (CIOs) of various firms, including those considered technology companies (TCs) and those considered non-technology companies (NTCs). Data was analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis to determine what factors influence the adoption of CC systems and, moreover, to determine what factors create resistance to the adoption of CC in firms despite its well-documented advantages and benefits. Additionally, by examinging and focusing on the factors of resistance, the rsults of this study were generalized across a wider array of firms located in the Southeastern region of the US.
A total of 12 categories were identified. These were organized into two groups. The core category being financial risks represented the probability of loss inherent in financing methods which may impair the ability to provide adequate return. The categories lack of knowledge, resistance to change, excessive cost to adopt, and cost saving fit under financial risks. Together these categories were indicators of the factors of resistance to adopt cloud computing technology. The core category security risks represented the overall perception of privacy in online environment. The categories process of research, accessing organization fit, perceived security risks, phased deployment, approval to adopt, and increase flexibility fit under security risks. Together these categories were direct indicators of the factors of resistance that contribute to the adoption of cloud computing technology by both TC and NTC. The result of this study showed that the predominant and critical factors of resistance that contribute to cloud computing adoption by TC were financial risks and security risks vs. security risks by NTC. A critical distinction between TC and NTC is that 86.4\% of NTC’s participants did not care about cost, they only cared about data security.
A model was subsequently developed based on the lived experiences of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) who have been faced with challenges regarding cloud acceptance, and cloud computing adoption. The theoretical model produced by this study may guide future researchers and enhance the understanding and implementation of cloud computing technologies. The results of this study will add to the body of literature and may guide companies attempting to implement cloud computing to do so more successfully.},

	abstract = {A renewed interest in cloud computing adoption has occurred in academic and industry settings because emerging technologies have strong links to cloud computing and Big Data technology. Big Data technology is driving cloud computing adoption in large business organizations. For cloud computing adoption to increase, cloud computing must transition from low-level technology to high-level business solutions. The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for cloud computing adoption that included Big Data technology-related variables, along with other variables from two widely used technology adoption theories: technology acceptance model (TAM), and technology-organization-environment (TOE). The inclusion of Big Data technology-related variables extended the cloud computing's mix theory adoption approach. The six independent variables were perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, security effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness, intention to use Big Data technology, and the need for Big Data technology. Data collected from 182 U.S. IT professionals or managers were analyzed using binary logistic regression. The results showed that the model involving six independent variables was statistically significant for predicting cloud computing adoption with 92.1\% accuracy. Independently, perceived usefulness was the only predictor variable that can increase cloud computing adoption. These results indicate that cloud computing may grow if it can be leveraged into the emerging Big Data technology trends to make cloud computing more useful for its users.

	abstract = {As information systems leaders tap into the global market of cloud computing-based services, they struggle to maintain consistent application performance due to lack of a process framework for managing quality of service (QoS) in the cloud. Guided by the disruptive innovation theory, the purpose of this case study was to identify a process framework for meeting the QoS requirements of private cloud service users. Private cloud implementation was explored by selecting an organization in California through purposeful sampling. Information was gathered by interviewing 23 information technology (IT) professionals, a mix of frontline engineers, managers, and leaders involved in the implementation of private cloud. Another source of data was documents such as standard operation procedures, policies, and guidelines related to private cloud implementation. Interview transcripts and documents were coded and sequentially analyzed. Three prominent themes emerged from the analysis of data: (a) end user expectations, (b) application architecture, and (c) trending analysis. The findings of this study may help IT leaders in effectively managing QoS in cloud infrastructure and deliver reliable application performance that may help in increasing customer population and profitability of organizations. This study may contribute to positive social change as information systems managers and workers can learn and apply the process framework for delivering stable and reliable cloud-hosted computer applications.},

	abstract = {Organizations are finding it difficult in today's economy to implement the vast information technology infrastructure required to effectively conduct their business operations. Despite the fact that some of these organizations are leveraging on the computational powers and the cost-saving benefits of computing on the Internet cloud, others still show reluctance in the implementation of cloud technology due to security and privacy concerns. This study examined factors that influence organizations in the adoption of cloud computing technology, integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). In the spring of 2012, this study conducted an online survey through Survey-Monkey. Data were collected from 105 respondents in information technology across many organizations in the United States of America. Multiple regression analysis was utilized to examine if there was a correlation between the five independent variable factors (attitude, subjective norm, behavioral control, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) and one dependent factor (behavioral intent). The results showed a significant correlation of 70\% variation between the factors and behavioral intent. Cloud adopters from the financial industry were found to exhibit a higher adoption rate than other industries analyzed. A total of 79 male and 26 female respondents participated. The age range of most participants was from 26 to 65. The findings of the study contribute to a theoretical foundation for future research and allow for better application of integrated Technology Acceptance Models.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the differences between organizations that adopted Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (Cloud ERP) systems and organizations that did not adopt Cloud ERP systems based on the Technological, Organizational, and Environmental (TOE) factors. Relevant technological factors were identified as relative advantage of Cloud ERP systems, compatibility of Cloud ERP systems, and security concern of Cloud ERP system environment. Organizational factors included top management support, organizational readiness, size of the organization, centralization, and formalization. External environment factors were identified as competitive pressure and vendor support. A survey was developed using constructs from existing studies of technology adoption and modified to fit this research. Using the survey, data were collected from individuals throughout the United States of America who identified themselves as working in an Information Technology (IT) job. Analysis from 159 respondents indicated that all the proposed TOE factors were significant predictors of Cloud ERP systems. In comparison to organizations that did not adopt Cloud ERP systems, organizations that adopted Cloud ERP systems had the following characteristics: higher level of relative advantage, higher level of compatibility, higher level of security concern, higher top management support, higher level of organization readiness, bigger sizes, more centralized, more formalized, higher competitive pressure, and perceived Cloud ERP system vendors as offering more support. In the final chapter of this dissertation, practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed, and suggestions offered for future research.

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides business applications and data accessed online using web browsers and dedicated clients. It enables usage of shared computing resources distributed around the world. The benefits of cloud computing include a lower total cost of ownership, flexible billing model, real time on-demand provisioning, resource pooling, and access to a broad network. The problem that was addressed by this research was cloud-computing adoption has been relatively slow among many organizations because of concerns about performance, security, compatibility, and adaptability, as the main technology factors. This study investigated the determinants of cloud-computing adoption, using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by measuring the influence of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and the effect of the technology factors of security, performance, compatibility, and adaptability on the behavioral intention to use cloud computing. The research model extended the TAM by adding those factors as external variables. This non-experimental quantitative predictive study was based on sample data collected from 153 respondents from an online survey. Link to the survey was sent to 1050 participants from randomly selected IT organizations in the small and medium-size business sector in the USA. Multiple linear regression as well as analysis of variance was used to assess the influence of performance, security, compatibility, and adaptability on the behavioral intention to use cloud computing moderated by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, It was found that performance influences intention to use cloud computing through both perceived usefulness (Regression coefficient — .481, p = .000) and perceived ease of use (Regression coefficient = .836, p = .000). It was also found that security influences the intention to use cloud computing through its influence on both perceived usefulness (Regression coefficient = .170, p — .002) and perceived ease of use (Regression coefficient = .148, p — .013). Compatibility and adaptability were found to have a combined influence on perceived usefulness, with a regression coefficient = .110, p {\textless} .05. No statistical evidence was found to suggest that compatibility or adaptability has any influence on perceived ease of use. Recommendations for future studies include assessing additional determinants of cloud computing, especially from individual and social factors and attributes, such as perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy of IT experience.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is quickly emerging as a promising paradigm in the recent years especially for the business sector. In addition, through cloud service providers, cloud computing is widely used by Information Technology (IT) based startup company to grow their business. However, the level of most businesses awareness on data security issues is low, since some Cloud Service Provider (CSP) could decrypt their data. Hybrid Cloud Deployment Model (HCDM) has characteristic as open source, which is one of secure cloud computing model, thus HCDM may solve data security issues. The objective of this study is to design, deploy and evaluate a HCDM as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In the implementation process, Metal as a Service (MAAS) engine was used as a base to build an actual server and node. Followed by installing the vsftpd application, which serves as FTP server. In comparison with HCDM, public cloud was adopted through public cloud interface. As a result, the design and deployment of HCDM was conducted successfully, instead of having good security, HCDM able to transfer data faster than public cloud significantly. To the best of our knowledge, Hybrid Cloud Deployment model is one of secure cloud computing model due to its characteristic as open source. Furthermore, this study will serve as a base for future studies about Hybrid Cloud Deployment model which may relevant for solving big security issues of IT-based startup companies especially in Indonesia.},

Usage of the term began in software development, with a long-standing combination of the two terms iterative and incremental having been widely suggested for large development efforts. For example, the 1985 DOD-STD-2167
mentions (in section 4.1.2): "During software development, more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in progress at the same time." and "This process may be described as an 'evolutionary acquisition' or 'incremental build' approach." In software, the relationship between iterations and increments is determined by the overall software development process.},
